Here is the details for the {table_name}:

```json
{table_json}
```

Based on this json object, think and write a class in SQLAlchemy.

*REMEMBER*: Already the `declarative_base` is imported and `Base` object is created. Don't add this piece of code in the output it will be REDUNDANT.
```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()
```

*IMPORTANT*: Output only your response as a Python code like in the below example, without other commentary and instructions. Make sure to import all the necessary classes and functions.
```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String

class Animal(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'animals'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    type = Column(String)
    price = Column(Integer)
```
