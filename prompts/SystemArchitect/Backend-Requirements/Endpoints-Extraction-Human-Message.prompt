Here are the details for the new project:

--------------------
{web_application_requirements}
--------------------

Based on these details, analyze step by step to extract the API endpoints needed to be created to achieve the full backend functionality.

1. First identify the number of endpoints required to successfully complete and meet all the requirements.
2. Then for each endpoint identify what should be the API type, input parameters, output and other important details.

*IMPORTANT*: Output only your response in JSON format like in the below shown example, without other commentary.
```json
{{
    "description": "Details about all the API endpoints.",
    "endpoints": [
        {{
            "route": "/api/auth/signin",
            "type": "POST",
            "input_params": [
                "username",
                "password"
            ],
            "output": "Signin user if the credentials are correct. Redirect to Index Page."
        }},
        {{
            "endpoint": "/api/to-do-tasks",
            "type": "GET",
            "input_params": [
                "user_id",
            ],
            "output": "[{{'serial_no': 1, 'name': '...', 'due_date': '...'}}]"
        }},
        ...
    ]
}}
```
