Here is the details for the {table_name}:

```json
{table_json}
```

Based on this json object, think and write a class in SQLAlchemy.

*REMEMBER*: Already the inputs and the Base is taken care of. All you need to do is write the code for the class.
```python
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()
```

*IMPORTANT*: Output only your response as a Python code like in the below example, without other commentary, instructions and imports.
```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String


class Animal(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'animals'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    type = Column(String)
    price = Column(Integer)
```
