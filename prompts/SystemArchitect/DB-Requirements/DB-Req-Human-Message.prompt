Here are the details for the new project:

--------------------
{web_application_requirements}
--------------------

Based on these details, think step by step to design the database schema for the project which will be using a lightweight RDBMS called SQLite.

1. First identify the number of tables which should be created to fullfil the requirements along with the columns that should be inside each table.
2. Then identify the relations between different tables.

*IMPORTANT*: Output only your response in JSON format like in this example, without other commentary:
```json
{{
    "description": "Detailed description of the database schema",
    "tables": [
        {{
            "name": "<<TABLE NAME>>",
            "description": "<<DESCRIPTION OF THE TABLE>>",
            "columns": [
                {{
                    'name': '<<COLUMN NAME>>',
                    'type': '<<COLUMN TYPE, Ex: Integer, String etc>>',
                    'description': '<<DESCRIPTION OF THE COLUMN>>'
                }},
                ...
            ]
        }},
        ...
    ]
}}
