It has some sort of dark parts later on, but I liked it.   Return of the King was so awesome! I finally saw it yesterday. Eowyn kicked the Witch King's ass! Ha ha! I especially enjoyed the adaptation for film of the above line. I forget exactly how it went, but I remembered that part from the book, so while I was watching, I was like, 'Say it... say it...' And Frodo and Sam had some very nice love scenes. And there were oliphaunts!   Thomas, were you gone because you had to return a Ring, or possibly because you joined the army, or possibly because you fell into a parallel dimension?     I know from sparrows to starlings. After that, everything's a duck, as far as I'm concerned.    ",2004-01-03

At first I didn't want to do it, but it turned out to be pretty fun. The make-up artists were like the best I've seen. So I hope I get to work with them again.  So what's going on with me and Mike??? I really don't know, right know it's like stagnant, and like nothing is going on but, that might change. It frustrates me that I never get to see him. Whenever he's not working, I am really busy, and when he's busy, that's when I want to see him. And soon he'll be going to college and I'm still gonna still be stuck in Algonquin.

12032006,Male,16,Student,"                  This week's CD  :   urlLink The Tipping Point  by the Roots  (Week of  7/12/04  to  7/19/04 )    Release date  :  July 13th, 2004  Rating  :   7.6/10  ( 3.8/5)   Get Audible  :  'Don't Say Nuthin',' 'Boom!,' 'The Mic'      'Where You Drew The Line'    The sentiment involved in getting pushed to the edge, becoming fed up with, or nearing the tipping point may be perfectly hallmarked by Black Thought not far into “Star/Pointro,” the Sly & the Family Stone-sampling opener to the Root’s 7th album: “Keeping it real will kill you if you end up letting it.” Thus, the album title, not able to be simplified to just a Malcolm Gladwell novel, is a definitive statement against continuation.   “The Tipping Point,” invisible to the critical and social world but easily perceptible to the Roots, is an outer edge, a sort of invisible fence for each member of the hip-hop super band .  So, the Roots chose to electrify and commercialize on this disc, in a way not to become electrocuted and burned out by that very fence (which may be caused by continuing their less commercial, more experiment sound of both “Things…” and “Phrenology”). That older Roots sound, which has come to be somewhat expected, is the “keeping it real” of Black Thought’s aforementioned diction, so shifting sound and style becomes the blueprint for much of “The Tipping Point,” a blueprint simplified into lyric during the choral attack of “Boom!”: “What we have here is a brand new sound.”  Taking a Phish-like approach to making this album, the Roots apparently jammed upwards of 25 minutes for each track, then nitpicked select beats to use to form song structures. Nitpicking, though, just starts to define their process, for each track then became a packaged piece of artsy hip-hop to potentially hit radio stations and t.v. stations. Much of the focus for this album is jazz, unlike the genre-hopping “Phrenology” of 2002. Perhaps, then, “Stay Cool” becomes the inevitable centerpiece, taking a secondhand De La Soul beat that morphs from a sunny-day jazz stroll to freestyle saxophone over a paranoid backing section. The lyrics push one of the simpler messages on the album (aside from the scat-babble attempted in the “Don’t Say Nuthin’” chorus): “Stay cool muthafucka’s y’all know the rules.” “Boom!” lies in the same vein; it sounds like a jazz-scratch response to the Beastie Boy’s recent “Ch-Ch-Check it Out.” With sax stabs and DJ wiggle alternating over trash-can drumming, Black Thought hyper-spits lines as happening as they are absurd (“It’s Black, code name Yafet Koto Ock”), seeming to play the harder, wiser cousin to Alfred Molina’s Spiderman-bashing Doc Ock. That antagonism is not foreign to Black Thought, and it becomes the role he most often slips into throughout “The Tipping Point.”  Spiteful and cocky are his words in the lead single, the two-faced “Don’t Say Nuthin’” (first face: commercial flop, second face: verbal drive-by through Chinatown), as he denounces the lesser and commends the greater, the Roots, and the great, himself. That beat (which oddly evokes Bow Wow’s “Let’s Get Down”) is pure Eastern-tinged funk, much like “Duck Down!,” a club-hopping Timbaland-esque track, boasting a sound seemingly achieved effortlessly that many of today’s producers try to imitate. Black Thought again plays the villain, potentially one-upping the late Hova by claiming to “spit what your wig absorb, sicker than sycamore.” Aside from self-endorsement, though, Thought takes a few political jabs, pronouncing that “every record ain’t a record just to shake behinds” over bleeding guitar funk and crawling bass dribble in “Guns are Drawn,” and later condemning those who “pray to Coca-Cola instead of the gods” in “Why (What’s Goin On?).”  All cockiness, jazziness, and seriousness aside, ?uestlove turns around his recent employment as Dave Chappelle’s music manager for “The Mic,” the first of the album’s pair of bonus tracks. Pure brouhaha, the Roots pull a Danger Mouse and drop what sounds like a Stones snippet beneath a rollicking crowd of hipsters (among them Chappelle) who claim to love the mic more than even the most impressive consolation, the opposite sex. This, of course, puts the mic and music above an endless list of wordly things, not to exclude the ever-feared concept of commercial success.  That commercial success is seen on “The Tipping Point” as the Roots cut out many elements of their past: A-list verbalists (Talib and Mos flow right off of the tongue), neo-soul styling (we’re thinking “Break You Off”), and clever wordplay in choruses to name a few. But, while high production values tend to classify this disc as being a commercial push, that never-failing mouth of Tariq Trotter (BT) puts the Roots right back on the cutting edge of commercialism. “They made a lot of money, [but] money never made them,” he aptly points out on “I Don’t Care,” a sequel to “Rock You!” In essence, it isn’t the money, the fame, the pop charts, or the girls that matter to the “legendary Roots crew.” It’s the thought, black or white, that they create music to be heard and loved, whether underground or more mainstream. This album sides with the latter, but nevertheless will bounce and bob with every spin. The only difference becomes, then, that where you drew the line, the Roots marked the tipping point.              ",2004-07-14
12032007,Male,15,Student,"                 Imagine waiting to meet the person you want to spend the rest of your life with, and then being told that you are not able to devote your life to that person through marriage. Imagine having tons of people look at you differently because of your sexual preference. This is what many homosexuals go through every day. They are faced with many issues that very few heterosexuals go through in a lifetime. It's pathetic that our government doesn't believe that you should be able to marry who you prefer if you are homosexual. They, however, do allow opposite sex marriages because to them that is what they feel is  'right' or 'normal.' Most of them feel that marriage is a union between a man and woman. Most feel that their religion tells them that it is wrong to have same sex marriages, so that is how they will vote. My question is: Since when do we base our government upon the thoughts and ideas of religion? Since when do we sacrifice the pursuit of happiness of others because a religion is against it? Our country is not based on religion. It never has been and hopefully never will. America is supposed to be a melting pot of different religions, ethnicities, and cultures. Many religions do believe in gay marriages. For example, Buddhism celebrates gay relationships freely and would like to have authority to make legal marriages. So if we do make a law against their religion, then we are taking their right to freedom of religion. If one believes in religious freedom, the recognition that opposition to gay marriage is based on religious arguments are reason enough to discount this argument. Another reason our government is so against gay marriages is because they feel that marriages are for the continuation of the species. However, I think that it is safe to say that the world is in greater danger of over population than under population. It seems that gay marriages would be doing the world a favor by not adding to the problem of starving children. Also, if marriage is for the continuation of the species, then why is it such a 'sacred' thing to do? The government is also concerned that same sex couples are not able to provide the optimum environment in which to raise children. Well that may sound like a good point, but keep in mind that murderers, felons, and even child molesters freely procreate every day. If they are allowed to, why not gays? I think that people are just not comfort- able with the situation and that they are going to come up with as many excuses as possible in order to stop them from marrying. Everyone is so worried about all the reasons gay marriage should not be allowed, but they are forgetting that there are far more terrible things going on in the world such as war and our soldiers dying every day in Iraq. How about focusing on the real problems we have in society instead of interfering with another person's happiness for something that should have never been a problem in the first place. Courtney Dufour The Chieftain Monitor    That right there in my opinion was one of the best arguments for same sex marriages, it explains from a semi-religious stand point how gay marriages arent so wrong as in the eyes of others. And like it says, isnt the constitution supposed to say somewhere that the government cant interfere or persecute any certain religion, so why then would it be ok to pass an amendment that would go against the Buddhism faith? They celebrate gay marriages as stated by the article, so if an amendment was passed then wouldnt it prevent them from practicing a part of their religion? Last I knew the government couldnt do that, but I guess that times change and so called democracies based on equality eventually become Communistic states but hey what are you going to do about it? Its time to get Bush out of office NOW before he has the chance to introduce this amendment, if a such amendment is passed then America will become forevermore the homophobic capital of the world, no more melting pot for us! Just an unfair inequality is what we get well I guess that I do have much more to say about that but my hands are cramping so ill save it for later.

12032011,Male,24,InvestmentBanking,"       Today was really an eye opener.  Working for Champion Sports Wear was a unique experience. In terms of working with ppl and in terms of getting to know puneites (as i am from delhi). The work itself was not that informative, but the people whom i spoke to made it interesting. eg i spoke to Sachin, who had been working there for the past 10-12 years and was the head of the childrens department. Never once had the thought of settling in Mumbai crossed his mind  - even though he was so close to it.  The shop itself, was started about 40 years ago by Subash Madan  (020 31013490)and today has his brothers, son's and nephews are running it and have expanded from one shop (4014118) to three shops (two in Deccan Road and one in Camp) and has also expoanded from sports wear to  include exercise equipment and accessories.His daily average turnover is about 30,000 -35,000 with about 20%-25% profit margin.  The most admirable quality about Mr. Madan was his down to earth attitude.The fact that he listened and took me in proves this.  Even though i have about one year of work experience in Citicorp, this is the first time i had the oppurtunity to meet a self made man. Someone who started something because he wanted to be different.   I  just hope that he is not the last.            ",2004-06-29

12032015,Male,37,InvestmentBanking,"             Two items of note from Congress.   First, we have  urlLink bad politics versus bad accounting :    The House voted Tuesday to override  urlLink a rule  that would require companies to count stock options against their profits...   The House vote was 312-111, with 198 Republicans and 114 Democrats voting for the bill that would block a proposal by the rule-setting board for accounting. The board is seeking to force publicly traded companies to record as an expense all forms of share-based payments to employees, including stock options.   ...Sen. Richard Shelby...derided the House action as 'political interference' in the work of independent accounting experts. 'I will continue to fight any effort to pass similar legislation in the Senate,' he said.   The House-passed measure...would limit required expensing of options to those owned by a corporation's top five executives. It also would allow newly public companies to delay expensing for top executives in the first three years.    I hope at some point to blog about why   option expensing is a total red herring and possibly the dumbest idea in financial analysis  . (For a primer, see  urlLink here .)   But that's not my point here.&nbsp; My point is that   Congress has no business micromanaging the FASB  . I couldn't find any numbers on how many House members have MBAs (they're all lawyers, remember?), but I guarantee you it's not many. And have you ever listened to the question-and-answer periods whenever Alan Greenspan testifies?&nbsp; Most of them couldn't pass a simple  urlLink Econ 101  exam. So these are the same people who are going to countermand the accounting experts? Bad on its face, and bad as applied.   Again,   I disagree 100% with the FASB proposal.   But I disagree 110% with Congress mucking around in an issue that few if any of them really understand. Leave it to the professionals to sort out.   Second, we have some  urlLink monopartisan gridlock :    Republicans are looking toward September to restart talks on extending three popular tax cuts as prospects for a deal this summer ended in deadlock   between the White House and the Republican-controlled Congress (SIC!!!)  .   The White House insisted that the three tax cuts, scheduled to expire at the end of this year, stay on the books for five more years. President Bush had asked Republican leaders to push a bill through Congress this week before a six week summer hiatus and the parties' presidential nominating conventions.   Lawmakers neared agreement late Tuesday to extend the three popular tax cuts for two more years. The shorter timeframe took into account worries among moderate senators, including a few Republicans, about record budget deficits.   The president rejected the two-year offer as insufficient, and tax writers pledged to restart talks when Congress reconvenes in September.  ...  The tax bill is one of several items that have seen Republicans at odds with one another over the impact of tax and spending decisions on record budget deficits.    It's one thing for gay marriage to divide the Republican party...but tax cuts?!? (And remember, this is not really about 'preserving tax cuts' ...   it's about raising taxes!  )   Sort of puts a damper on the whole ' urlLink Vote Gridlock ... Vote Kerry ' school of thought.       urlLink           ",2004-07-22
12032016,Male,37,InvestmentBanking,"             Want to see the future? Read  urlLink this New York Times piece  on the looming airline pension crisis:  [T]he federal agency that insures company pensions is facing a possible cascade of bankruptcies and pension defaults in the airline industry that some experts fear could lead to another multibillion-dollar taxpayer bailout. ... The  urlLink Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation  is already hobbled by debt, having picked up the pieces of more than 3,200 failed pension plans in its 30-year life. The scale of the failures has risen sharply in the last three years, but the agency has few tools at its disposal to prevent the situation from becoming worse. ...   [B]ecause pension obligations, unlike bank deposits, do not have to be paid off all at once, it is difficult to raise alarms about the threat.    'The real blowup doesn't happen right away; it happens over time,' Mr. Kandarian said. 'You've got to address it now, but it doesn't look like a crisis now. The crisis is always over the next hill.'   The risk is that the longer the problems are avoided, the worse they can get.   ... It wasn't supposed to be this way. In 1974, Congress responded to an ugly string of pension failures in the auto industry by passing landmark legislation. From then on, any company that promised pensions to its workers would be required to   set aside enough money   to pay them. Rules were written to determine how much money was enough. To weave the retirement safety net even more tightly, Congress also created the pension insurance program.  Those protections were hailed as 'the greatest development in the life of the American worker since Social Security' by Senator Jacob K. Javits, the New York Republican who died in 1986. But for many workers, those protections no longer look so secure.  '  You see that the whole thing could really be a house of cards that could come crashing down  ,' Mr. Dean said.  All the same phenomena as with Social Security: so-called 'guaranteed' benefits that in fact are supported by absolutely nothing except unenforceable promises (  there is no 'lock box'!  ); dubious actuarial assumptions, a slow crawl deeper and deeper into crisis, culminating in massive benefit cuts, bankruptcy and, ultimately, taxpayer bailout on a mammoth scale.  If you're under 40, this is what you can look forward to without privitization. This is exactly what will happen to Social Security, for exactly the same reasons, unless major changes are adopted immediately.

12032020,Male,34,InvestmentBanking,"                 If everyone in California and the nation didn't hear John's interview yesterday with Asa Hutchinson of the Homeland Security Dept, I'm highly suggesting that you take a few minutes and listen to it. It is so frustrating that politicians can't answer simple questions that are put to them.  urlLink Here is the link for the audio . The southern border is such a mess, but what also is a mess is the fact that two million illegal immigrants are in California at this time and finally when the Border Partol inland enforcement made headlines by grabbing over 400 hundred illegals in the Riverside/Inland empire, they are ordered to stop because the immigrant activists protested louder than us ordinary citizens. Here is a summary of the interview  A month ago, immigration activist groups like La Raza (The Race. How's that for a nice inoffensive name?) were howling in uproar because the 12 Border Patrol officers of the Temecula office were conducting sweeps in Temecula, Escondido, and Corona, all of which are cities located in Riverside and northern San Diego counties.  Complaints about these sweeps aroused the ire of not only the activists, but the Mexican government, whose LA consulate expressed its displeasure in no uncertain terms. Members of Congress also got involved, berating Homeland Security for the sweeps as well.  About a week after the complaints, spokesmen for the Border Patrol said that Asa Hutchinson the undersecretary responsible for the BP, ordered them to stop the sweeps. So, John got an interview with Hutchinson, which aired live this afternoon in the 4:00 hour.  John, who is not a tactful guy, bluntly asked Hutchinson why he ordered the patrols stopped. Hutchinson began droning on about the need for coordination, and about how many illegals (16,000 per week, according to Hutchinson) were being stopped from coming into the country in Arizona.  John cut him off and began demanding to know how many illegals were being rounded up in California. Hutchinson didn't know. John then began grilling him about how many employers had been indicted in Southern California for hiring illegals. Hutchinson said he didn't know. (John did. The answer: 0) John asked if interior enforcement sweeps would begin again. Hutchinson said he couldn't give away specifics about planned operations, for, you know security reasons.  John then pointed out that, if we were unable to stop economic refugees from pouring across the border, how could we possibly stop al-Qaida? Hutchinson said that, yep, that was a pretty important question. You betcha. John asked how Hutchinson planned to react when, after the next 911, we learn that the terrorists came through the Mexican border in California. Hutchinson said that it was really important to stop them.  At the end of the interview, John kept demanding a yes or no answer to the following question: 'Can I tell my listeners that Asa Hutchinson assured me that the interior sweeps by the border patrol would begin again?' Hutchinson refused to answer.         ",2004-07-07
12032021,Female,26,indUnk,"   Well, the weekend is over.  You might say, well, it'll be around next weekend, only 5 days away.  Well for me that would be 14 days.  And the last full weekend I was off before this one was actually 4 weeks away because I had to work July 4th, which of course fell on my weekend off.  I usually work every other weekend, the WHOLE weekend.  Which for me brings about so many thoughts and issues.   First there's the Shabbat thing.  I don't like working on Saturdays, I miss not having Shabbat, I miss not going to Shul.  But I couldn't find a job in the PT hospital world without having to work SOME Saturdays.  Well then I chose the job with the MOST Saturdays.  Not that I don't like my job.  I love the hosptial, love the people I'm working with, Love Acute Care, and I get days off during the week to make up for the weekends, but those every other weekends are just starting to wear on me.  And I miss Shabbat.  I feel out of touch with the rest of the  world.  I'm working when people are off and off when people are working.  So my weekdays off, while good for Doctor appointments, aren't good for seeing your friends who work a normal 40 hour work week with all weekends and holidays off.  I mean I live with Rob and I feel like we don't really get to spend time with each other, our schedules are so out of sync.  And why is it that every single weekend I'm working, the weather is perfect, and then it rains on my weekends and weekday comp. days off?  ANYWAY...  this wasn't meant to be a negative sounding post.....So what was my point before I started rambling about working weekends...  Oh yeah I was going to talk about my weekend off.  It was a good one.  Not the best, it had its goods and bads but mostly it was a good weekend.    Rob and I went to my cousin's engagement party.  it was actually a REALLY nice day Saturday, though hot, it was a nice relaxing day sitting in the backyard with family and friends, eating and talking etc.  It was nice.  Saturday morning before the party I spent time watercoloring, which was really relaxing.  And I got to get up later than 6AM!  (It's weird when 8:30 seems like sleeping late)  Suunday Rob and I went to NYC for the day, which didn't quite work out how we wanted it to. I think we sepnt more money yesterday doing nothing than we meant to...  We had brunch with a friend, but couldn't figure out what to do afterwards.  We tried the Planetarium and the Museum of Natural History but the lines were sooooo long so we just decided to go home.  The highlight of being in the city was sitting on the bench in the middle of Broadway deciding what to do, and this homeless man, comes by spouting things about kosher bagels and lox, and shelter, and how women like him because he smells so badly.  It was kinda funny, made us laugh, though if you look at the story thats probably behind the homelessmess its kinda sad.  The man was probably mentally ill, thrown out of a home/hospital, off his medications, etc.  It's so sad at the lives wasted like this...    So, with the lines to long at the Planetarium, and both Rob and I tired, we ended up coming home to CT, and relaxed the rest of the afternoon.  So it turned into a pleasant Sunday.   And today is Monday, and that was my weekend.  I'm very protective of my weekends, try to make them good ones.   I think I mostly succeeded.  Spent time with family, Spent time with Rob, Spent time with friends, Spent time sleeping, Spent time being creative.  :)  And so now it's Monday.  I'll be off Thursaday, work the weekend, and then off Monday, work the rest of next week, and in 14 days I'll have a weekend free again.    And so my life goes.   More later, for now it's time to get patients out of bed at the hospital.  :) ",2004-07-17

12032029,Female,16,indUnk,"       I spent a lot of time in my life worrying myself about my friends. Sometimes the worry would lie squarely in the way of trust, sometimes it would close me off, sometimes it would eat at me. It’s weird to admit to have been so lonely, when I always had people at my house or visa versa. Particularly when I was younger, I always had a gaggle of pals around me. But there has always been this terrifying sense of “Oh my god, they don’t  really  like me. It’s some sort of joke.”   That’s really what’s so cozy about Robin and Lauren. I don’t second guess why we’re friends. It just is. They’re the kind of people that will politely suffer through a half-hour rant about a minor musical detail, without clenching a fist or changing the subject. They accept my faults, oh yes; there are lots of them. But I think we  all  recognize our own shortcomings. So what if Lauren takes several minuets to recite to a joke? Or if Robin likes to wear lip gloss like its sunscreen? Because for every time they’ve pissed me off, I have pissed them off just as many times.  I wonder if this is what being an adult is like. It seems to me that once you begin to recognize who you are, you can form stronger relationships with the people around you. It sort of like when Death Cab for Cutie sings about Los Angles, “You can’t swim in a town this shallow”. You can't expirence the depth of human connections unless you're, well,  deep .  Once you begin to explore the inner depths of who you are, there is enough of you to befriend. Before, when people like Claire and Maryellen- and even Mary- were my buddies, there simply wasn’t  enough person  to know. How could I expect them to forge lifelong friendships with me when I didn’t even know who I was?  Affectionately... Anna          ",2004-05-11

I'm very happy about it and for the first time ever, I'm looking forward to the cold weather just so I can wear it. :p I will post pics in a couple of days.  ***  Now. I still have two WIPs, both of which I'm a bit bored with. I'm working on my illusion scarf right now (I have a bit more than a third of it done).  I will receive the Noro Kureyon beauties soon and they will be made into a bag.  But I also have one million projects in mind and I can't decide which one I want to make next. So here's me organizing my thoughts...  I have two knitted presents planned for the holidays.   Mom : I'm hesitating. I can go simple and knit her a scarf. Her coat is white and red. So the colours would have to go with it. I know she LOVES my HP scarf so I may go with a similar style (in the round and all). The other option would be the Chinese charm bag from Stitch N' Bitch. I already have the handles and she loved it when she saw the picture in the book. I just don't know which yarn I'd choose as I don't know where to find Noro Gemstones. If not, I guess I'll choose another brand of variegated yarn. I just need to be very careful with the colours to make sure she will actually use it.   Sister : My first idea was to make her a scarf and if I have time, mittens or a hat to go with it. The problem is that I have no idea what kind of coat she's gonna wear this winter. So I wouldn't know which colour to choose. Hmmm. Option #2 would be felted slippers, like the Fuzzy feet from Knitty. It's marked as a 'tangy' pattern though. But it really is just a huge pair of socks and I've been meaning to try socks anyways. So I don't know.  I really need to figure out what I'm gonna make and start soon since I'm such a slow knitter.   Projects for me that I have in mind :  -A poncho AND/OR a shawl AND/OR a blanket. Basically, just something that I can bring at work to wrap myself in when I'm cold and everyone else is hot so I can't turn on the heat. I just need to find the perfect pattern first.  -A sweater. I want to make my first sweater and I want to make it now. :p I'm hesitating between To dye for, from the SNB book or the Surplice Cardigan from the Fall 04 issue of Vogue knitting. It's very pretty and marked as easy so maybe I could manage to make it.  -Socks. I really want to make socks. Any socks.   So many projects, so little time.  ***  Thing to add to the 'I want it but can't knit it yet' list: Charlotte's Web. I wish.      ",2004-08-14

The record showcases some great work from Bobby Hutcherson -- slid into the mix in a really sly way, so that his jazzy vibes color all the tunes with an edgey feeling that's missing from most of Duke's other albums. The group's slightly largeish -- with Jerry Dodgion on flute and alto, Sam Brown and Al Gafa on guitar, plus added Latin percussion on a number of tracks -- but although the larger group format often made for softer edges on other Pearson sessions from the time, the mix here is quite different -- at a level that works in complicated rhythms, rich colors and tones, and warm harmonics that have a slightly unsettling undercurrent. The album's worth it alone for the mighty title cut 'The Phantom' -- but the whole thing's great, and other tracks include 'Bunda Amerela', 'Say You're Mine' and 'Blues for Alvina'.' - dustygroove.com  'Duke Pearson was nicknamed by an uncle who admired Duke Ellington's music. As a youth he studied piano and several brass instruments, but dental problems prevented his becoming a professional trumpeter. He worked as a pianist in Florida and Georgia (1954-59), then moved to New York, where he played most often with Pepper Adams and Donald Byrd (Byrd recorded his best- known compositions, 'Jeannine' and 'Cristo Redentor'). He also joined the Jazztet briefly (1960) and toured internationally as the accompanist to Nancy Wilson (1961).  From 1963 to 1970 Pearson worked as a producer for Blue Note records. During this period he formed a big band, initially led also by Byrd; as the Duke Pearson Band (1967-70), it rivaled the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Orchestra, which also shared some of the same personnel. Its soloists included Adams, Frank Foster, Jerry Dodgion, Lew Tabackin, Randy Brecker, the trumpeter Joe Shepley, and Garnett Brown. The ensemble provided a forum for the performance of Pearson's lyrical, swing-oriented compositions. In 1971 Pearson taught at Clark College, and the following year re-formed his band with virtually the same musicians as before. He toured with Carmen McRae and Joe Williams from 1972 to 1973; in the late 1970s his ability to play was impaired by the onset of multiple sclerosis.' -BARRY KERNFELD,The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz          urlLink  http://entertainment.msn.com/artist/?artist=106641            ",2004-08-02
12032034,Female,24,Non-Profit,"           friday five    I don't have much to post about today.  Today was just another average day and I don't want to be toooo repetitive in my blog...so I decided to try out the  urlLink Friday Five  again.   1. What are your favorite ways to relax and unwind?   I like reading books, going for walks, being by myself, watching a good tv show...or listening to music.   2. What do you do the moment you get home from work/school/errands?  When I get home from work, I normally either make something to eat or change out of my clothes.  Then I play with Hannah, eat dinner and relax.     3. What are your favorite aromatherapeutic smells?   Hmmm...I like lots of smells...I think my favorite smells though are vanilla, watermelon, lemon and raspberry...   4. Do you feel more relaxed with a group of friends or hanging out by yourself?   It depends on if it's my friends, or if they're people I dont' know too well.  When I'm with my friends, I am very relaxed, I can be 'me' around them and they don't judge me and I don't 'feel' like they're judging me.  When I'm around Deane's friends, who I don't know that well still, I feel a bit un-relaxed...they are all very nice, but I still don't know them too well, and when I'm around some of them, I feel the age difference between us, and I feel the fact that I have nothing in common with them, I didn't go to school with them, I don't know them at all really...and that makes me a bit uncomfortable.     5. What is something that you feel is relaxing but most people don't?   Hmmmm...I don't know.  I know of things that other people do to relax that I don't find relaxing...like smoking and drinking, and partying...a lot of people I know think of a relaxing weekend as going out and getting drunk or stoned and going crazy with parties ... and I don't find that relaxing at all...fun maybe (minus the smoking and stoned part!)...but definetly not relaxing.    I guess maybe I like going to Disneyland, I think that's relaxing and a lot of people don't.  But then again, I have an annual pass and never feel 'obligated' to rush around and take in all the rides.  I can enjoy the littler things at the park, and sit under a tree or something with Deane and Hannah if we want.

12032047,Female,26,Banking,"       My husband and I were snapping at each other today. We had to take our nephew to his baseball pictures. Let me draw you a little picture of what it is like: take all the children ages 6-12 from a 30 mile radius, cram them in a hot room with photo equipment that is somewhat like a generator, then add cookies, cupcakes, and soda charging huge prices that would make the US government blush. This is my first time doing this so now when Soccer season comes up we should be better prepared.   I can feel myself starting to level off, but there are warning signs that I can see. I'm wanting to be alone a lot, I'm tired all the time, and I have had difficulty with anyone touching me. There are, however; have been improvements I am not hearing voices and the scratching in the walls has stopped. I've also started to do my relaxation therapy.  The worst part of this is learning how to openly feel my emotions. I've never been good at doing that. I've been good at taking all of the negative thoughts, feelings, and actions and putting them away where no one can see them. My Mother used to always say 'Heather, Smile' well it was really difficult to smile when I was thinking about taking a whole bottle of aspirin.          ",2004-05-22

So next week I can email everyone pictures of the kids.  The ultrasound is so detailed that you can see their faces, fingers, eyelashes etc..   Some of the people at work who were pregnant did'nt want to get the scan because they thought it would be too creepy to see what their kids looked like before they were born, which may or may not bother me, I don't know...   I know my mother in law is excited about seeing them, Dale's cousin had a 4d scan done with her first baby (and maybe the 2nd one, Im not sure....) and it is really amazing.

I'm also torn between wanting to see How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days or that new Shanghai Noon movie. Chris realllly (in a guy way) wants to watch it, whereas all I can think about is when we had to sit through The Tuxedo.  i stayed hoping it would get better, but I now wish I had walked out after the first thirty minutes. I still haven't seen The Hours, it's a travesty, I know!    in Ms. SAT (stinky ass teacher) news, it turns out a library book I had been missing for over two months has been in her possession all along. AND another book that is considered LOST by the library, resulting in a $17 fine, is probably also in her possession. If I don't get that book back, I am going to scream bloody murder. Apparently she has been sneaking into our rooms to use valuable and rare supplies, such as rubber cement and construction paper.  It is impossible to work with a person who sinks so low as to steal office supplies on the fly.    In CRAZY chaperone parent news, she confronted me on Wednesday morning, asking me why her oh-so-not-perfect daughter who was recently chastized for hitting other kids was given a 'needs improvement' rating on her progress report. The oh-so-not-perfect Parent went on to tell me I was a control freak and that my kids could not have fun on the field trip because of that.  But I, I would not sink to such a level,  NO , I am proud to say, I spoke to her calmly and rationally, cutting her down to size with good sense.  But she is still a crazy awful person that I have to deal with all the time.  And the  Biggest News  is Feb. 15-17 I will be off to new york city after what seems like forever of not having a trip (and drives to maryland do not count!). Now I can explore somewhere (almost) new, and have fun with my friends while doing it. As I told Kathryn the only word I can say is 'yay!'         ",2004-08-04

12032053,Male,25,Education,"           Another easy-going day today.  We're still singing the Christian pop song in class, but, rather funnily, this has proved to be *not* popular with the kids!  They don't like singing the song!!  I doubt it's for the same reasons why I don't like it, but they groan and whine everytime I put it on.  Maybe it's too mellow and boring even for their tastes.  The kids are REALLY into the Westlife songs and hell I'll listen to My Love a million times in a row over one listen of the painfully boring and cheesy and poorly-choreographed Power Of Your Love!  Either way I have to confess that I kinda smirk everytime the kids resist singing the song.  We still have to practice it everyday and I enforce that, but I'm glad I'm not the only one that doesn't enjoy this song.  When their next dance practice is for the Power Of Your Love, I haven't heard anything...  Still no barnyard furry friends in school today...that makes me very happy!  :-)  So I've been feeling a bit sick all week, having come under a bit of a cold since the weekend.  I had been fighting it quite well all week long but today it seemed to have caught up with me.  By the time the end of the day came I was SO TIRED and was just feeling really achy and headachy.  I just wanted to relax at home after work and go to bed early, but couldn't because I was heading into the city to meet up with Brad and the gang.  We're going on a tour of the DMZ tomorrow (the buffer zone in between North and South Korea!!!) and because the tour starts so damn early we're getting a hotel room tonight.  I packed up my overnight bag and then watched a bit of TV before leaving.  Yesterday in the mail arrived another package from Barb - FOUR (4!) videotapes full of my fave shows, plus some Easter candy, including the much-coveted Cadbury Mini-Eggs!!!!  BARB YOU'RE THE BEST!!!!!!  Ahhh....there's nothing like laying on your bed, watching Survivor, and eating your most favourite chocolate in the whole wide world!  I took the train into central Seoul and met up with everyone - Brad, Andrea, Amy, Steve, and 2 new girls - Kelsey and Emily.  The girls had booked 2 hotel rooms near our pick-up spot for the tour and I was excited about staying overnight in a hotel.  I LOVE STAYING IN HOTELS!!!   I've always been like that, not sure why.  I get so excited to stay in a hotel, doesn't matter where or how nice or shitty the room is.  And when you're with a big group of friends it's even more fun.  The 7 of us went out for a drink at a bar across the street from the hotel, and then it was time to hit the hay.  I CAN'T WAIT FOR TOMORROW!!!  To think I'm going to get to see a corner of the globe that hardly anyone ever gets to see - one of the most hostile borders in the world - a place where the Cold War still burns fiercely.  It's gonna be amazing!  Oh, before I forget, there's a website that you *HAVE* to check out!  It's called match.com and it's one of those many silly online dating websites, but I discovered it thanks to a friend of mine who had mentioned about taking The Physical Attraction Test which can be found on this website.  I took the test and it was so much fun!  It's a very in-depth test where you are shown various pictures of people and you have to choose who you find the most attractive.  Later you're given comparitive photos and diagrams of various head, face, profile, and body-type shots and you have to do the same thing.  What this test does is scientifically figure out *exactly* what kind of appearances you are physically attracted to.  It's extremely thorough and when you're finished it gives you a very detailed report of all the specifics that, for whatever reasons, seem to turn your crank.  It's really fun and fascinating because my report described me to a 'T'!!!  It was like this test found a way to get INSIDE MY BRAIN and discovered exactly what I go for.  One of the many things that it told me was that I fall into the 'Extremely Picky' category - a group of people that are so small (or so damn picky!) when it comes to picking mates that they make up only 1% of the total population!!!  WOW!  This explains why I've been single since before time began!!!  Anyways you should take the test for sure, it's really cool!  Just make sure that before beginning the test you have a good half hour to an hour to kill cause it takes that long to go through the test and then read all your results (I told you it was thorough!!!)  To take The Physical Attraction Test, visit:  www.match.com  and you'll find it there on the main page.  Let me know how you liked the test!!!  :-)         ",2004-03-28

I suffered alot after being depressed.  So I am so happy, I feel I can get away with too much.   I was vain.  I was very impatient.  I wanted my hobbie to work.  I have 'friends' on the other side.   They tell me I can get friends in the real world - they see me for who I am.   So I talk to them alot.  I asked them to give me power.   I am very upset I hurt you.  I only tried to help myself.    I want other friends.  Very bad.  But you seem to be the only one who cares.   I should not have let this out on you.  I am strong, and will make more friends.

Mission accomplished last night at Jun's, an AWESOME and AUTHENTIC (or so I'm told, because I really have no measuring stick at this point) sushi place in an Overland Park, Ks. strip mall with my friend Marisa, of the writers' group fame, and her husband Todd, who I debated in high school. Both swear it's better than the joints they haunted in NYC together, and I believe them!   Marisa is beautiful and funny and talented. She's the kind of girl it would be fun to be jealous of, but you can't be. She looks like a brunette Reece Witherspoon and wears great shoes. She's a teacher, seeker, writer and documentary playwriter, and she was more than enthusiastic when I mentioned I wanted to try sushi last Sunday. So, Friday night, here I sit, cross-legged, warm sake on my tongue, with a whole lot of raw fish in front of me and clumsy chopsticks.   Bless her and the Unagi she so loves.   Sushi is delish! I'm particularly fond of the salmon, tuna and sweet shrimp. The halibut was tasty. Tuna gushy and flavorful and the California roll OK. Nothing to write home about, but good nonetheless.  I'm hooked. I want to go back. Now, let's see...   What else is on my list? Suggestions for 26? (It's coming soon in September!! Yippee!)         ",2004-06-12

Right after I sent you another 'invitation' email, you showed up as being in 'pending' status, but, now you don't show up at all.  John, Lis, Monica - get on the ball and sign up for goodness sake.  You've all been 'pending' for weeks now.  We want your active participation here, so give us what we want.  Welcome to Lisa!  Lisa, I got the pictures that you sent.  Where the hell did the picture of Rob, RHODA VALPATEC [sp?], and myself come from?!?  I don't remember that occasion at all!  By the look on my face, it must've been while Rhoda and I were 'going out'...  What was I thinking?  The big group picture must've been at some dinner party - was it a COUPLES thing?  That one is so good that I think that I will just figure out how to post it in a actual post rather than shrinking it down to fit on the side.  If I shrunk it, you wouldn't get to see everyone's bright, shining faces.  Oh, and the one of you 4 Purdue Ladies [that's what I named the photo] is just SO college.  Amber and Derrick have been sent 'invitations' to join!  Amber is now completely aware of what we are doing here, but it looks like she might not be able to attend in December.  I'll let her tell you why when she signs up and starts posting.  As for Derrick, I found an email from him off of his personal website:   urlLink http://www.forchetti.org/ .  Oh, and exploring a little more there, I just found an MSN email address that I will try sending something to as well.  Haven't officially gotten his attention/participation, but hopefully we are on our way.  Oh, and I'm hoping that Amber can get us back in touch with Amy Davis.  She [Amy] contacted me a few years back, we lost touch, and a couple of weeks ago  I tried calling the number that I had for her but it wasn't an active number anymore...  I called Ream's parents last week and left a message on their machine asking them to pass along to Michelle my contact info.  Haven't heard anything from her yet, so I may call them again this week.  I did a search on whitepages.com for 'Winquist' and 'Chesterton' - assuming that HER parents were still in the same place - and came up with a Winquist on some strange street that I had never heard of.  Anyone know where she and Rob are [I'm assuming that they are married by now...]?  It seems like when I last heard from/about them they were both working/in school at UIC.

12032060,Female,24,Education,"             I went to Chicago last night, and I have to say that it was fabulous.  I was amazed at the level of talent those students.  They were primarily sophomores and juniors in college, and this was practically a Broadway level show.  I was particularly impressed by 'We Both Reached For the Gun.'  The girl playing Roxie Hart was extremely convincing as the puppet.    Today has been a very long day.  I had to go into work an hour early for a staff meeting.  I was planning on leaving an hour early to make up for it, but that didn't happen.  Plus, I had an event tonight, which meant that my day was only half over.  I'm had a 'Karaoke and Mocktails' night that had a really good turnout.  At first, there were only a few people there.  However, throughout the evening, I ended up with almost 40 people in and out, and everyone had a really great time.  I even got one student who doesn't really participate in much of anything to not only show up, but sing.  Go me!  Now I'm totally wired, and I feel like going out to do something, but... no one is around.  I would be tempted to just go out for a walk, if it weren't for the fact that I now live in a not so great portion of Utica.  Oh well.  I'll live.  Other random things to tell you all:   ~I hung a clock in my bathroom the other day.  Just a normal wall clock.  That thing has the loudest tick I have ever heard.  I can literally hear it clicking throughout my entire apartment.  Last night, when I was trying to go to sleep, I was in my bedroom (as far from my bathroom as you can get in my apartment) and I had to turn on music to drown out the ticking to get to sleep.  ~Sometimes, people just need encouragement.  There is a student at my new job that every staff member has warned me about.  This student has apparently been a problem child for quite a while now.  However, I've been really trying hard to give this person a chance, and ... it seems to be working.  Now granted, it's only been three weeks, but I've noticed that when this person is treated like that--a person--the reaction is absolutely a 180 from when this person is treated the way everyone else seems to.  Amazing how that can work, isn't it?  ~Two guys singing 'What a Girl Wants' is just far too frightening for words.  Please don't let this happen to you.           ",2004-04-22
12032061,Male,25,Engineering,"                 If anyone knows of a place I can work full time, let me know please.  God, I hate this.  I spent several more hours on the Internet researching jobs I would be qualified for with a BA in Interpersonal Communication, and there's some things that don't sound too bad, but I can't suddenly become a copy writer or advertising specialist without experience.  This is too depressing, and the 60 degrees and rain aren't helping either.  I was actually contemplating going to one of those computer training schools for computer graphics and design stuff, but I would need money to pay for it, and a job to supply the money to pay for it, and if I had a job, I probably wouldn't want to do that anyway.    In other news, Roy Halladay owned the Yankees yesterday, and it was enjoyable watching the Jays win a game, since I hadn't seen them win on tv since the end of May probably.  In a way, I kind of feel bad for Jeff Weaver.  I don't like the Yankees, but if he was on another team that was mediocre, he wouldn't be scrutinized nearly as much.  Yeah, he isn't very good, but when Josh Phelps blasted that 3-run homer in the 8th yesterday, Weaver's head just fell, and I actually felt sorry for him.  The game was over anyway, because fat Wells allowed 5 runs before Weaver entered.  Oh well.  Today doesn't feel like Tuesday to me.  And it doesn't feel like September.  It feels more like the middle of October.  Dreary and chilly.  Well, here's another part of my story:    Corey brought me to his house.  I thought he was hiding something from me.  He didnt say much since Andy showed him the newspaper in the morning.  I told him to take me to my home, since his absence of mind wasnt contributing to any comfort for me.  I would have been better off alone.  Maybe I could clear my head and forget about things for a while.  Corey walked my to my door and made sure I was in before retreating back to his place.  He ate some pizza and watched the game all night.  He knew not to call when I ask him to be alone for a while.  I always called him when I was ready.  It was six oclock, so I watched the news when I got home.  They reported that Sammy had apparently left town and the police couldnt trace his whereabouts.  He was gone.  They fucked up.  Commercial.  I was too worked up to eat dinner that night, so I continued to watch the science channel until about ten.  I decided my eyes were tired at that point, so I went to sleep.              ",2003-09-02

The theme was 'Old School' and they played dust in the wind... haha. Anyway, they showed all the characters (will ferrell, Blue, andy dick  etc.) and finally got to Luke Wilson.  They went to a guy in the audience and it WAS IN FACT  LUKE WILSON .  We had major 'Jumbotron eye sex'!He was at the game supportin' the 'Stros.  I just started cracking up because the Old School cast are like my IDOLS! The fact that they were playing 'dust in the wind' just made it all the much better.  He was sitting approx. 365 feet away from me. I know this because he was sitting at home plate and I was sitting right behind the 365 ft. homerun marker close to center field.  Ha, im a dork.  Anyway, they also put him on the screen again when they were doing 'Brake for a kiss', which is where they lock the camera on two people and they are supposed to kiss.  He kissed his 'girlfriend' but i like to think it was just his sister.        anyway, it was the highlight of my night if you couldn't tell.        Today is brianna's birthday Party.  The funny thing is half the people she invited are my age or older.  She invited kelcee, mike, carlos, sara, adam.... i can't think of who else. Everyone else is her age.  She is a TEENAGER (13).  I already gave her the talk.  I told her to start making friends with all the guys at school now because the girls will turn into major bitches in about 2 years.  She thought i was joking. But it's the truth.. making friends with girls is a waste of time.        ummmmmmmmm, i would like to write more but i cant thin of much to say.  I can say that my ass hurts pretty bad.  I guess you shouldn't get a tattoo on your butt if you have a job where you do nothing but sit all day.  But at leas its not peeling.... yet.      Sue,  It would have been cool if you ended up with the rocks because then you would be able to walk around with the rocks and pretend like they were a digital camera and take pictures with them.  People would ask 'why are you carrying that rock everywhere?' and you would simply reply with, 'This is my digital camera you idiot!' It would make for some good times.  But then again, you could just do that with any old rock. Good story shawna.      HOLLA           ",2004-08-03

The beer is good, in variety and volume; if libations were a bullion currency then the Canadian standard is gold, or maybe platinum.  Expert beer consumer Chris Ness has this to say, 'it's the middle road, its not quite German quality, but it is better then American beer.  You can also get some bad Mexican beer.'  Really isn't that what's important, I mean who wants to be as crazy and single minded to the devotion of beer craft as the Germans?  If we were where would me find the time to have such a high nation sex average (time / year) or time to partake of the nectar of the grain?  Yet we do strive for a level of quality far above that of our southern cousins, because they drink shit!  So raise your bottles, cans or kegs in salute this weekend, and drink Canadian Gold.

12032081,Female,26,Communications-Media,"           So it's been over a week since the wee little bean joined our family. Erika and I are both walking zombies, although Eleanor is still the sweetest little girl -- when she needs to eat she doesn't mince her words -- or her wails! Everyone warns you that life will be different when you have kids and you sort of accept it before the big day arrives. Yet, I cannot even begin to describe how profoundly different our lives are now, but it's all for the better.  I will be working at McGill & Partners Communications full-time this fall. I've been working there and up at the university this summer. Busy, busy. At McGill, I have and will be doing research and writing. I've been gathering information for 3M Canada on corporate philanthropy -- because they want a good cause to give money to -- how 'bout me? Then I've been conducting market research and interviewing people in the know. I also write corporate newsletters -- including all the upcoming edition of ClimateCare's 'A Matter of Comfort'. Thrilling, eh? This whole job stemmed from the mysterious 'internship' Diny Dalby spoke about in class. So now they've asked me to stay on, which I'm willing to do because lets face it -- they've got more money to throw at me than the Grand Forks Gazette did. Exactly how much remains to be seen. But I'm just relieved I will be employed come September 1.  In the meantime, I'm also volunteering my time to Terri at Scene -- just to keep my self honest. Although communications and advertising can be at times more fun than reporting -- plus in my humble opinion -- I think it's more creative than stodgy ol' journalism -- yet my heart is still with journalism. I will continue to keep my feet wet and look for the dream job.  The shepherding thing has been fun. The new group is a lot of fun. It's been a riot laughing and joking with a new crowd of people going through exactly what we did last year.  All is well. The baby is finally asleep! Whew.

12032100,Male,24,BusinessServices,"       As all guys know from their dads, you never buy a car without test driving it first. Why is it then that these ignorant, bible thumping kids pledge to remain abstinent until marriage? I mean we all know that a good percentage of them are lying through their teeth. The others are divorces waiting to happen. I'm by no means advocating that these boys and girls become 'sluts' or 'playas' (not that there's anything wrong with that. I for one loooove sluts). But at the same thing, a large part of love and marriage is sexual compatibility. I mean you may find out afterwards that you do not share the same sexual peccadilloes as your spouse.  Take the case of Jack Ryan, senatorial candidate from Illinois and his former wife, Star Trek vixen Jeri Ryan. Things are great, he's so loving and stable. They get married and holy shit, he's a freak. He wants to go to sex clubs, is an exhibitionist, etc. Wouldn’t you want to know about this before hand.  Take this hypothetical situation for example. You have the love of your life, your high school sweetheart, You date for years, share the occasional make out and heavy petting. Then you get married. And that night, on your honeymoon, the sex was just blah. Nothing to write home about. She doesn’t like giving head, or he has no technique. Whatever the problem is, you just bought a lemon so to speak. Now you have to pay more money than it cost to get married to get divorced. Plus, there's the social stigma attached to divorce to contend with. how will your family and friends react? Co-workers? And the clergy at your house of worship? (I worship myself, so I'd be forgiven)  This leads me to believe that the only answer is to get on my soapbox and advocate pre-marital relations. Young men and women of America, it's time to get out there and take what's yours. The time is ripe for a second sexual revolution and I'm the first to join.

12032107,Female,26,Sports-Recreation,"   Hey all, I hope you had great weekends. Mine was one to remember, I got the opportunity to go on a free 3 day scuba trip to San Clemente island. It was aboard a luxury yacht out of San Diego. There were 4 of us diving plus a crew of 2. The 3 other divers are all published scuba photographers and journalists. They sure taught me alot in 3 days. Now about the diving it was phenomenal!! Visibility underwater was from 40'-85'. During one dive I did find myself alone with about 5-8 sharks all about 5 to 6ft in length. I was a little nervous but they were not aggressive. I also got to dive with a giant black sea bass which is in the picture below. Altogether I made 7 dives in 3 days all were very memorable. ~Dan P.S. also I found out the picture with 2 diver (I'm the diver in the distance will be used as a poster for the upcoming San Diego underwater film festival.

12032108,Male,17,Sports-Recreation,"           Every once and a while during the summer I think about the coming school and it gives me shivers. This year, for me, will be the hardest and probably the most stressful year of high school yet. I've got a heavy academic course load and I'm taking Bio 12 and French 12, which are both really hard provinical examable courses. The work will be tough, but for me, the worst part is the stress of trying to do well enough to get into commerce at Queen's. The weirdest part is I don't really want to go all the way out to Ontario for school, I'd much rather go to SFU or UBC here in BC. I'm not sure why I feel pressured to go to Queen's because my dad said he didn't care where I went or if I went to university at all. Anyways, I'm also gonna be working a lot to get some money for school. So I think the thing I most worried about this year is not having the time to see the people I care about. This post is kinda boring, so I'm off and next time I'll think of something really cool to write bout. Cheers, Mick          ",2004-08-05

12032110,Male,17,Sports-Recreation,"           happy friday!  there were a lot of pretty good performances last night by pitchers, only one that i would call a great one, so we will lead off w/ that one.  here it goes: yesterdays best: z. day Mtl: 9 IP, W, 0 ER, 6 H, 0 BB, 4 K against the royals.  day has been doing well this year, despite a 5-6 record, he has an ERA of 3.12.  if he gets some more run support, either through offense or a trade, he could win 15+ a season.  he is a very good young pitcher. c. zambrano ChC: 8 IP, W, 2 ER, 5 H, 4 BB, 7 K.  he is a top 5 pitcher so far this season IMO (schmidt, r johnson, a. benitez, clemens). 7-2 with a 2.27 ERA.  his curveball has a lot more on it this year than what i have seen before.  he is able to depend on that pitch as well, and i think that he has potential to maintain this all season. c. fossum Ari: 6 IP, W, 0 ER, 5 H, 2 BB, 5 K over Bal.  his counterpart, bautista for Baltimore had a perfect game thru 5 or 6 i think, but gave up a 3 run shot the next inning. this was definitely an aberration (he got his ERA below 6), so i wouldnt look for another similar performance any time soon. c. pavano Fla: 8.2 IP, W, 1 ER, 4 H, 1 BB, 7 K.  another pitcher quietly having a good season.  while beckett and burnett are struggling, pavano has been the marlins' rock in the rotation.  2nd straight very good start (6/4 7.2 IP, W, 1 ER), and 6-2, 3.10 on season.  he might be peaking right now, so i dont know if i would hold on to him for the rest of the season. k. ishii LA: 8 IP, W, 1 ER, 6 H, 1 BB, 4 K. also having a good season (8-3, 3.36).  he is getting a bit more run support than last year, not by much, but more nonetheless.  he has shown improvement each of the last 3 yrs, especially w/ his control. c. schilling Bos: 7 IP, W, 2 ER, 6 H, 2 BB, 8 K.  always good for a solid performance, schilling has had a consistent season. for his price, you could probably get a marginally better pitcher, but he is not going to let you down very often.  if you have the money, he is a smart pickup.  those were the best performances of last night.  some pitchers to look for good things from tonight are: livan hernandez Mtl: plays at seattle tonight, who has been a struggling offensive team.  hernandez is known as an inning-eater, so i will predict 7.2 IP, 2 ER, 5 H, and a win (why not go for it all w/ my predictions?) tim hudson Oak: a safe enough pick, playing at home v. Pit, whose offense had been struggling, although they scored 7 yesterday.  i will say 7 IP, 3 ER, 7 H, and a win for tim.  i think the A's can match however many runs the pirates throw up there. al leiter NYM: has an ERA this season below 2 (1.78 i think).  playing against KC only enhances my confidence in him.  i kind of want to say CG shutout, but leiter probably doesnt have that much endurance in him.  7 IP, 1 ER, 2 H, win. brett myers Phi: plays at Min, home of the 'evil ventilation system'.  he will overcome this hardship and get a win in 6.1 innings.  he will give up 3 ER and 6 H. i know this to be a fact (not really...had you fooled there) scott schoeneweis Chisox: my 'out on a limb' pick for the night, he had a great rookie year 3ish yrs ago (along w/ rick ankiel), and has done well this season as well. performance of the night v. Atl-CG 3-hitter, 1 unearned run, 2 BB, 9 K, win.  there you have it, who says i dont have the balls to predict stuff?  hope this is helpful and accurate.  if you find any errors, you will get mentioned in my next post, and maybe you will win a new car!  any comments regarding format and or content are always welcome.  good luck, and have a good one!

I'm really glad that they printed something like that, but it was still a bit 'weasely' for me. I'm trying so hard not to be bitter about it, too. Most more liberal news/commentary sources are so bitter and pissed off about it. I totally agree, though. It is a bit 'too little, too late'. And NOT on the front page, though they are starting to run stories about faulty intelligence and the other scandals, but isn't that just the same thing they always did? Run the big scandals on the front page? I've had a bit of a problem with the NY Times ever since after Sept 11. I used to read it religiously, because I thought it was a vastly superior paper to say, the LA Times. It surely still is, but it is still just a paper. It is just another large, corporately owned media outlet. I don't know exactly who owns the Times, but they are definitely not independent. I know that everyone has an agenda, and everyone is slanted. There is no such thing has a truly independent, 'objective voice'. I just hate when things are reported as the 'truth'. 'WE are the NY TIMES. WE are better'. That is the real problem, I think. At least if I read Guerilla News or something, I know I'm going to get an angry rant, and I can process it as such.                ",2004-06-02

Because due to a sudden twist of events, I had to be the master of the ceremony - the emcee, that is. It was an impulsive decision to take the part and it was worth it. There were tounge-twisting moments and reading bloopers but i believe they were barely noticeable. I did fine and I'm glad I took the opportunity to speak publicly (eventhough it was just a brief stint). Darn, it feels good!I feel like I'm born to do it. Hehe.  Yesterday was another euphoric day. I've heard from my oldest bestfriend through e-mail and i am so happy she wrote. Thanks a lot to friendster, I found her youngest sister who in turn informed her about me.She wouldn't have recognized me if not for my posted pictures in my profile. She said that she has been trying to contact me for ages but with no such luck. Nwez, she gave all her contact details and a brief account of what has happened to her through the years. She graduated, got her own store and a 2004 Mustang. Cool beans, huh? For someone my age, I guess she already accomplished a lot. I wonder if she already got married. I did ask her this question in my email to her so i'll just have to wait and see...  Reuniting with an old bal brings a sense of nostalgia. I just couldn't help but reminisce about old times and reflect about the present as well. Somehow, I tend to ponder and analyze my current situation with that of my friends (one of human's natures?)I start to question how I fared so far - in life, generally. Well, success is something difficult to quantify. I think success is relative, a state of mind, really. It is something that can't be measured by material wealth, forune or fame one has achieved but rather by the fulfillment one feels with the things that she/he does. Success for me is going to sleep at night thinking that it feels good to be alive and feeling lucky to be where and who I am today.  Well, there are symbols of status quo and I wouldn't be a hypocrite to admit that I would want some of these. But I wouldn't want to own some possessions which I think I don't deserve. I don't know but if one believes she/he is successful, everyone else follows - fulfillment, recognition, as well as the material rewards that go along with it.  Success - an abstract term defined as the 'progressive realization of one's pre-determined goals'. Or something to that effect.And it got me asking myself, what are really my goals? Do I have concrete ones? Hmmm...        ",2004-06-28

I learned some new techniques, which I kind of suck at so far. I did my first satin stitch applique on a project. It turned out pretty well, except for the starting/ending points which are really obvious. I also attached bias tape around the edges, which did not go well. The fold wouldn't stay on the edge of the fabric, and it just did not want to go around curves well. So I'm not extremely pleased with it, but it was my first time with bias tape.   I also need to find some kind of fabric marker that can be removed. I was using a quilting pencil, which would not come off with the eraser or with water. The chalk liner that was recommended to me had the same problem. I'm not sure if this is because I was using white fabric or what. I scrubbed the fabric too hard, but my scrub lines were covered up by the rickrack.   But overall, it was a quick, easy project that helped me learn some new stuff. Hopefully the second one I make (with a bunny applique) will be better.          ",2010-10-10

I relented and said we'd go into town and check cheap tickets at the Leicester Sq booth. A cramped sweaty tube ride later we arrive @ the booth 5 minutes past 7. It shuts @ 7!  Leg it to the theatre. Cheapest tickets £10 with restricted view. Am strong - say no. Leave theatre for food at West End Kitchen. Resolve crumbles over much needed lamb chops. Back @ theatre 7.50. Restricted view not so bad! Then I look at the set. Tis 'The Bible'! The only one I've seen! 'I thought you said it was Shakespeare tonight!' 'I didn't.. You assumed it and I didn't correct you!' False pretences or what! Anyway made Nell buy the half time icecream for such trickery - stem ginger mmmmn cold icecream with an unexpected hot kick.  Anyway the Bible was exellent. Simon, John and Mikey working a lively audience, many from over the pond and the Bush / Michael Jackson jokes well received. Timing of the foreskin sketch was crap which made it even funnier. The Genesis / Peter Gabriel joke way over the top of most but it cracks me up! Disaster almost struck with John as Goliath trapping his costume under the box - again one of those unintentional laughs. Girls for the Old Man Noah had an Ark looked too well rehearsed... we suspect they may have been before - especially after the fish impersonations.  After the show we went backstage... I didn't expect I could drag Nell away to catch a quick bus home... Simon came out first and chatted to us and some visiting Americans. John came out - with golf clubs - and gave Nell a lovely big hug, which made her night. The boys asked her about her mum (away in the States) and sister (Christian concert in Ealing) and John asked me about Fulham (had my Champions Polo shirt on) They have season tickets amongst the show crew and go and see them regularly. Mikey came out later and ran off with John' s golf clubs.. sold them for a tidy sum to finance a pint I gather.. They larked about in front of the cameras we all had kissed and shook manly hands and disappeared off pubward. Nice guys.  Evening slightly clouded by the non arrival of the 14 bus, 20 minutes and no show Ken! Tube back to Fulham costing me full fare for Nell (after 10.30 - the hour children magically grow into adults according to London Transport) - she's nearly there anyway but that's not the point. Eventually got home Winchmore Hill way at 12.30 ish. Knackered but happy. And I'd done over15,000 paces on the MaccyD Pedometer!!!          ",2004-08-06

12032135,Female,47,Museums-Libraries,"       Today, I was in Mansfield, Ohio, for the annual INFOhio Planning Conference (which I mistakenly referred to as a 'retreat' in an earlier post). INFOhio is Ohio's set of statewide resources for school libraries, a complement to  urlLink OHIOLINK  (for academic libraries) and  urlLink OPLIN  (for public libraries).  I took this speaking assignment with a little trepidation, because I wasn't sure how school librarians would react to the scan. I didn't need to worry. These folks were ON, and they were eager to talk.  First, it was like old home week. Terri Fredericka, the director of INFOhio, has been a friend for years. Joanna McNally, the president of OELMA, was in my groups at Library Leadership Ohio and Snowbird, and will be a major leader in libraries in years to come. Ellen Stepanian would be a good role model for Joanna; she's been a leader in school libraries on the local, state, and national level for years, and was a mentor with me at Library Leadership Ohio several years ago. I know I learned at least as much from her as the program participants did.  Several things really seemed to resonate with this group. The concept of getting to the 'smallest publishable unit' seemed to carry, and they were amazed with some of the statistics about  urlLink I-Tunes , and about Microsoft's  urlLink Janus  project.  But what really got things cooking was when I asked about the concept of IT professionals moving from the 'T' to the 'I' in their titles. There was a spirited discussion about the way IT staff are working with faculty to corner the market on classroom information delivery through services like Blackboard and WebCT, leaving librarians out of the process. So who's fault is this? (By the way, I had enough sense not to ask the question quite this blatantly---it came from an audience member!) Some of the people in the room said school librarians need to get out of their rooms and insinuate themselves in this process. Getting the library's website and information connections visible in the classroom systems should be a top priority for school librarians, they said.  After I finished speaking, a high school librarian came up to me and said she was thrilled that OCLC had seen some of the things she's been seeing in the environment. She said that she'd had her library remodeled this year, moving the books to compact shelving and putting the information technology front and center. She had convinced her board that the library had to reflect the way young people are learning now, not when we were in school. (I don't know about you, but my biggest obstacle in going to grade school was evading the dinosaurs.) Several librarians volunteered to participate in focus groups if OCLC wants to learn more about their segment of the market.  This was such an energizing event that I can't wait to get to Victoria tomorrow and take my turn talking to the Canadian Library Association. I wonder why Delta wouldn't let me print out my boarding pass tonight. Hope it's not a bad omen...         ",2004-06-16
12032136,Female,47,Museums-Libraries,"       This week, I have two speaking engagements to talk about the Scan.   On Wednesday, I'll talk to the annual INFOhio planning retreat in beautiful downtown  urlLink Mansfield, Ohio .  urlLink INFOhio  provides databases to K-12 schools thoughout Ohio on a statewide basis. This group includes both IT staff and school librarians (are they still called school media specialists?) so it will be interesting to see how they react to the Scan's contention that the locus of IT is moving from the 'T' (technology) to the 'I' (information).  urlLink The Ohio Educational Library Media Association   underwrote  urlLink a very interesting report  on the role of school libraries in educational attainment, and I'll be weaving some of the results of the report into my comments.  Friday, I'll be at the  urlLink Canadian Library Association   meeting in Victoria, BC. I'll be part of the OCLC Update Luncheon there, and as always, it's a pleasure talking to people who are enjoying a free meal. But I'm really curious to see how the report resonates in Canada. Today, Alane Wilson (one of the Scan's gurus) is talking to the  urlLink Canadian Association of Research Libraries  annual meeting, also in Victoria, so we will compare notes when we're back here in Dublin.  Happy Flag Day!         ",2004-06-14
12032137,Female,47,Museums-Libraries,"       Cindy Cunningham was the third speaker in the Symposium, after Cathy De Rosa's opening comments and brief overview of the Scan, and Dan Chudnov's comments on freedom and collaboration.   Cindy has been a very popular speaker in the library field over the years for several reasons. She's been at the heart of some of the most interesting projects in the infosphere, including being the metadata maven for Amazon for six years, and she is a terrific storyteller. Today she talked about the state of 'search' in the minds of some of the big search engines. She talked about how companies like Amazon and Google have developed search strategies that are based on using past searches as the basis for predicting what future searchers will want, and by seeking similarities that use context to help determine what the searcher is really after.  She noted that the point of the new search engines is to make finding the information you need as simple as possible. You had to know something about the subject you were pursuing to use the bricks-and-mortar library, but search engines have removed this as a barrier. You can start from any keyword, and in many cases, even if you spell the keyword wrong, you'll get a running start. The search engines do this by impinging just a little on each user's privacy, and for the most part, the users don't mind. They appreciate the convenience, and aren't concerned that their search information is being amalgamated into the larger engine to refine searches for themselves and future users.  Cindy said that libraries have always appealed to diverse audiences with diverse collections, and the more we as librarians knew about our users, the better able we are to serve them. (Parenthetically, as a former reference librarian myself, I always felt this was why a face-to-face reference transaction was usually more successful that one over the phone. I could tell the approximate age of the person, I could tell by his or her body language if what I was saying made sense or if I was headed out to La-La Land, and if the person generally seemed pleased with what was being delivered. None of these cues came over the phone.) Search engines are trying to reproduce this 'learning behavior,' and they are even trying to build in some of the serendipity experience of browsing the stacks in a well-stocked library. ('If you like this information, maybe you'll like...)  The 'search' business is changing constantly. Yahoo has just purchased an Indian search engine company. Amazon has spun off its home grown search capability into a  urlLink separate company . All the companies in this space are striving to line up content.   The next step will be moving from trying to identify what the user wants to trying to deliver what the search engine  wants  the individual to want. She pointed up several examples from the commercial world where, all other things being equal, the engine will direct the user to the product which provides the engine with the best financial return. This seemed to surprise some in the audience, although, upon reflection, it's not hard to understand. (Another parenthetical note: When I shop at a supermarket, I know that the end displays aren't there because these are the best values. They are there because the supermarket manager has made a deal with the wholesaler or the producer to put them there. Sometimes these products are what I want, sometimes they aren't. In this way, the web store is no different from the bricks and mortar store. If I want unbiased information, I'll pull out my copy of    urlLink Consumer Reports .  ) Cindy mentioned that one of the projects that the search engines are working on is being able to reconcile data from multiple sources to develop the most reliable information possible.   Cindy noted that the physical and virtual worlds are becoming more and more interrelated, and making the bridge between the two is also an ongoing area of concern. One forms a mental map of a virtual space, such as a library layout, and then must translate it to the physical world. This is a cognitive leap that has to be accommodated for users.  Finally, Cindy talked about how, in the first wave of technology, we tried to simply automate all the old library functions, without really thinking about how or if they should be automated, or if there might be a better way to do the services in the first place. For the most part, we've gotten over that.  Then we tried to imitate everything that the dot-com world was trying to do. We're still in that wave in a lot of ways, but we're getting a little better.  Now, as a profession we're starting to move into the sphere of realizing that there are certain things we do well, and that we should be capitalizing on those things to leverage and ensure our future. The knowledge and experience that the library profession have developed and honed over the years will be more valuable as information becomes even more pervasive.   She closed her remarks by quoting something she had heard  urlLink Bill Clinton  say at BookExpo in Chicago a few weeks ago. He'd said that he was optimistic for the United States despite the extreme polarization abroad in the land. He noted that at nearly every point in US history when the country has become severely polarized, it has chosen unity and international involvement as a way out. After the Revolution, after the Civil War, after the Great Depression and World War II, after Vietnam, we sought to unify and look outward. The sole exception was after World War I, and this had dire consequences.  Cindy noted that she thinks the library field will choose unity as well as we collaborate and cooperate to improve our profession.  In my final post on the symposium, to be done later tonight, I'll tell you about the discussion that closed the session. Good stuff there, too!         ",2004-06-24
12032138,Female,24,Museums-Libraries,"           Hello everyone. I didn't blog yesterday because it was such a busy day. I worked at BabyStyle from 2-7 but I closed so we ended up getting out at about 7:45 instead. It was so frustrating and literally every part of my body hurt. I was going to come in the library and blog but seriously, my body couldn't stand it.   My boss left yesterday for Grand Rapids, Michigan. He got there and they lost his luggage. I felt so bad for him because of all this trouble he has had with this trip. He is gone however and I have the house to myself. I am having a friend stay with me so that the monsters don't come out and get me. You gotta love when you have a friend who loves you and is willing to stay! I love my friends! :)   Work is going a little poorly because of the drama of losing our store manager. I have no idea what happened with that but I know it's drama and we are getting a lot of crap for it. It seems I either picked a great time to get hired there or a terrible one. I hear that we are really trying to improve the store and that had a lot to do with her needing to leave but either way, it's hard when it's your first week. I am a little frustrated but I have agreed to stick it out a little longer to make sure this is where I want to be. I don't particulary need the job because I could work other places but seriously, I kinda like it and I don't want to leave until I know that things aren't going to improve. If they improve a bit, I don't mind staying.   I have been doing really well on my weight loss since starting this new job. I am on my feet and running around so seriously, I have lost 2 lbs this week! So excited about that and I got into a pair of jeans this morning that were a size smaller. How exciting is that?!   Well, I am going to close this post for yesterday. Later today, I will blog on what happens today! Obviously! ;) Have a great day everyone and love you all so much!  ~Shalom~          ",2004-07-10

I dont know if shes hunting for a relationship though I mean shes a sweet girl and her hearts in the right place but damit shes hugging 30 and if she hasnt gotten her shit together by now its not going to happen. She just lacks drive or ambition she can tell you what she wants but shes not doing a damn thing to get it. I dont know my brains all over the place on this one considering horny hits me like a hot flash and  I lack the ability to stay focused. Shes an April Taurus that puts her high on the stubborn meter.

12032144,Female,26,Accounting,"           So we just got back from a weekend of motorcycle mania.  It was quite fun I must say.  Not so excited to be back at work though.  My first full week in about a month.  Pretty much sucks even though I'm doing more of the emailing than the working...but whatever...I still have to be here which pretty much blows.  Why can't I have a sweet job that gives me the summer off and pays me for it.  Or shoot...why not the whole year!  What I wouldn't do for that job.  Anyhow, here are some highlights of the weekend: 1. Cory and 8ball on the walkie talkies.  I think their next occupation should be truck drivers.  They've aced the most important part of the job - CB radio kings.  2. Fixing Christi's car hood on the side of the 46 at 2am.  8ball mcguivered it with a license plate screw, strap, and duct tape.  The key to the job was definitely the duct tape.  What a sweet ride that was after its makeover.  The green machine definitely would have made the Top 10 list of Best Hoopdies.  3. Wine tasting.  Enough said on that subject.  I mean really...we all know I'm the wine queen!  4. Riding on a motorcycle with 8ball.  I was pretty much scared shitless and swore that I would never get on one of those death machines.  But 8ball finally wore me down.  I had a great time and am looking forward to riding with him again.  I just need the proper equipment.  My sister has pretty much stated that I will be murdered if I do not get proper footwear.  So I'm going out this weekend and getting some steel-toed boots that will save my little footsies from serious damage.  (And I'm definitely of the mindset that I don't really ever want to have to put them to the test!  So you better be safe with me Mr. 8ball!)  5. Motorcycle races at Laguna Seca (the whole reason for the trip).  8ball brought them up a couple of months ago and stated that he didn't want to miss THE races at Laguna Seca.  I was thinking that 2 days of watching motorcycle races was pretty much going to be the death of me.  But thankfully...they rocked!  I had a great time.  We sat in awesome seats, right on the track, in the Aprilia tent. Those guys ride SOOO fast!  It's pretty cool watching them on the turns and hauling ass down the straight-a-ways.  Very fun.  On the whole, the weekend rocked.  The Laguna Seca Race Weekend will definitely make it into the 'annual vacation' register on the ol' calendar.  :-)  On a side note...can everybody say Kern River in one week's time?

Now if I could just see my Adam then I would be happy.    Jayel - I caught Dan's reports too about the prison workers.  I haven't seen Greg K. today either but I think I read somewhere that today is his birthday.  He usually appears on Thursday through Sunday lately.  I guess being the new guy in DC he gets the weekend shifts.  I saw James Rosen for the first time the other day in what seemed like months.  I used to see him every morning but lately he wasn't on much.  Nat - I read the article and that was great that he kept in touch with those guys.    Ellen and Nat - I missed Survivor - completely forgot it was on but got the scoop from my mom.  I missed a lot of it this time because I had class on Thursday nights so I would catch it here and there.  Were you all surprised by the winner??  Denise - I agree it was great to wake up to Rick this morning.  NYC was hopping and very beautiful for the holidays.  I think next year we are going to go around May when it is warmer and less busy maybe.  I don't know if NYC is ever not busy but the holidays are really bad.  It is only a 4 hour drive from my house so it is an easy weekend trip.  I know it was snowing again today.  It didn't amount to anything.    Well gonna go watch That 70's Show and The OC.

I guess we will see if I get a response.  Well at least we know he will be on The Fox Report this weekend.  I'm going to the beach so I'll have to tape it and watch when I get home.  I guess there were no Rick sightings today.  I'm babysitting for my best friend and she has digital cable at her house and it doesn't get Fox New so I'm going through withdrawals.

12032148,Female,24,Accounting,"            The Big Cheese   Just a short side-note, up until yesterday, I never did quite feel like a... boss, even if it was a low powered one.  It might have to do with the way our company culture is, or the fact that some of my staff are older than me.  Either way, it was quite a surprise that one of my staff, one I considered a pal, instantly call me on the cell after I expressed annoyance at her leaving before her 9 hours of work was up.  While I know I had a point, I wasn't all that pissed, since she only left around 30 minutes before 6:30, so in the hierarchy of sins, its reasonably venial.  However, she immediately called me up and apologized profusely.  Too profusely.  I don't know if I really like the feeling that people will consider me as something other than a friend.  Then again, professional life would surely take a short-cut to hell if they didn't.  Oh well...   Girlfriend Needs   Recently, a very close friend of mine disclosed that he and his girlfriend had a fight.  The reason:  he wasn't spending enough time with her.  And while I do have reservation with this girl and her methods of, er, communicating her emotions, I did see her point and to be honest, I kinda sided with her.  Maybe its something universal between girlfriends.  I may not like her methods, but I empathize.  I am a firm believer that if you commit to a relationship, you better be ready to commit your time as well.  I'm not saying anything like dedicating your entire life, but a significant amount should still be allocated at the very least.  It is also your duty to try and understand and participate in the respective worlds of your gf/bf.  After all, if you don't, then your journey will remain separate.  What would the relationship be for if it wasn't to spend a part of the trip with your significant other?  Again... oh well...           ",2004-02-05

Some go to the extent saying courage is of two kinds. One - the courage you show in life to overcome the various failures in life to succeed, which we call the strength of mind. Two - to fight back when somebody assaults you, the physical strength.  Some say the rowdies or bullies are hiding their fear of failure in life by trying to show courage by bossing over the others and showing that they are superior.     But whatever said courage is a combination of both physical and mental strength. Most of us can take failure in life in stride and be successful but how courageous are we when encountering a thief or dacoit or any anti social element.If they can sense fear in us we are dead but if we can instill fear in them then we win the battle. That is what happens when we are encountered by a thief or so as fear is instilled in us.     Therefore, I conclude that concealment of fear is courage and nothing more. As usual please feel free to comment and thanks for your patience.          ",2004-06-01

12032157,Female,26,Technology,"             It might as well be a Monday!  I know it's Tuesday but it feels like I have lived three Mondays in a row already this week.  After coming home from the dentist (I'd rather move to Iraq, as those of you who know me can figure) I was already in a petrified state.  I was cranky because I could not eat (couldn't feel my lips) and proceeded to add chlorine to the pool, which makes me sneeze like crazy.  When I turned back the cover there was a HUGE dead cockroach in the pool!  GROSS!  Returning to my office after the chlorine, I realized Olly dumped the trash and scattered it all over the room, eating all the plastic in the process.  I cleaned it all up and went into the bathroom, at which time the wooden cupboard door jumped out in front of me and scraped my knee all up.  As I screamed in pain and cursed and swore, I went to the other bathroom for some bactine and stepped in kitty puke on the way.  Olly had thrown up in the hallway after eating all the plastic.  As if all this wasn't bad enough, I went to find the carpet cleaner to see that there wasn't any left.  I tried to find something to clean the carpet and came across another cleaner, which I grabbed and headed back to the hallway to clean the kitty barf.  Stubbing my toe on the couch, I couldn't take it anymore!!!    To top everything off, I have a 4:30 appointment to get measured at the gym that I joined.  This is my first session with my personal trainer, Brandon.  After all that has happened, the least enjoyable evening I could have would include having my fat content documented and my flexibility criticized.  I hope Brandon is nice to me!

12032158,Male,17,Technology,"       Ok, heres the post about Sat. that I told people, on Sat. that Id be posting, but procrastinated  as is my nature. (lol)  I woke up at 10:15 from a phone call from Andrew who had just woken up too. (We were both planning on getting up somewhere in the area of 9, and we did, but we both went back to sleep again - LOL). I got ready as quickly as possible, but right as I was heading out the door, I was stopped by my dad who declared that I wasnt going anywhere until I cleaned my room, vacuumed the house and washed the dishes. I weaseled my way out of that, but it still seemed to set me back about half an hour more Andrew just eventually met me at a McDonalds by his house. We at brunch there and headed off to the mall (illegally, yes in Oregon you have to have your license for 6 months before you can even drive one person under 20, outside of your family.  dumb law, I think, but I guess there are enough stupid kids my age here to warrant passing more laws to restrict them.)    urlLink   Andrew at McDonalds.    Once we got to the mall, we met up with Ddee and Kristy and headed over to the bus stop. Little did we know that would be the start of the first many, many loooooong waits at bus stops all day (but its all good, thats when we would talk the most  waiting for busses)    urlLink   Ddee and Kristy waiting for us at the mall      urlLink   part of a wall of mirrors that always reflect straight back at you  I was a ditz and used the flash.      Once the bus finally got there (like  an hour later), we rode it to a transit center in downtown Portland, but before we got off, we met an interesting couple that seemed rather... high. We (the four of us) had been talking about fire and explosives, specifically my friend and his dad blowing up a microwave in some random field on part of their property. These two college students who had just boarded the buss set about trying to convince us not to become Unabombers, but if we were going to, to become artistic Unabombers. The guy started going off on how the world needed more art and culture and less hate, while then girl started letting phrases she must have heard from a stoned professor somewhere fall out of her mouth like, positive aura less negativity means a better life and peace not war, love not hate. She was doing this is perfect combination with the rather elaborate movements her arms kept making at random intervals. HAHAHA We all burst out laughing for a full 30 seconds or so, as we drove away from the stop at which they had exited.  After waiting for another ten or so minutes downtown, we boarded another bus which took us to the Oregon City Transit Center. In this bus we met another quirky, if not quite so amusing fellow who seemed to take a little too fond a liking to Ddee and Kristy. O, btw, he was drunk too. We were sitting at a right angle along the side and back of the bus, with Andrew one seat ahead of the guy, Ddee and Kristy two seats behind him and me two seats to their left. I was seriously thinking about just getting up and sitting between the guy and them since he was seriously making me nervous, but Andrew beat me to it by moving our stuff out of that seat and sitting between them and me. The guy procceded to give us a rather lengthy life story about how he was too rich and too smart to work, and how he grew the best pot in the state, right in his own backyard. I think we got him to think he wanted to get off at a sooner stop than he would have by how many times we asked him which stop was his, but who knows maybe he did live there?  Once we got to the Oregon City Transit Center, we waited for another half hour or more for the next and final bus to arrive that would take us to what we have now dubbed as the POC (Piece Of Crap) Fair.  While we were waiting, Ddee and Kristy pretended to fight for at least 20 minutes. I took what would have been some better pictures of them doing that, but my camera SUCKS so none of them looked anywhere near good.    urlLink   I think Ddee just kicked Kristy, but Im not sure.       urlLink   Kristy rushing Ddee.      urlLink   This thing is seriously attached to his head. (lol)    Once we got to the destination, we quickly realized it wasnt as  [insert gratifying adverb here] as it was made out to be. We thought at first we should name it the kiddy fair, but we liked the other name better. I had a headache, so I just acted as coathanger while the other three went on the grand total of two rides (the only ones that werent geared toward the 4 foot and under crowd). I got some  fairly good pics of them on the first ride.    urlLink        urlLink        urlLink      (Ok, so one fairly decent pic of them, two fairly good pics of the ride  lol)  We spent a whole half hour of quality fun time at the fair and then proceeded back to the bus stop, where we waited for... over an hour for the next bus. The stop happened to be next to a building which had an overhanging roof over a porch. This was good for poor Ddee who was far too hot in a sweatshirt, in the blazing (relatively) sun.     urlLink   Andrew looks like hes got the whole ape thing goin on, but dont worry, hes just on his cell.      urlLink   If this isnt Hickville, then I dont know what...      urlLink    My question is how to get the vehicle up there to begin with. Who knows, maybe YEEHAAs 4x4 enough (man enough in the truck world)    After the bus finally got there, we had to share it with four rather intoxicated 20-some-odd year old guys who didnt seem to have a problem spreading the news that yes, you will get drunk in the beer garden.  After we got back to Portland, we ate dinner in the lower food court of Pioneer Place 2. (I wish Id gotten some pictures of that place, the fountains make it look sweet. :)  We had an uneventful bus ride back to the Washington Square (mall that we started at), and decided to browse around for a while, in search of a game for Andrews friend whos b-day party I was taking him to.    urlLink   Andrew and me in the WS Summit bathrooms... see Ddee, this has nothing to do with showers ;)    HAHAHA, somehow I lost my key to my car at the fair (at least I think I lost it at the fair), so I had to call my parents and have them come give me a spare key.

I innoculated a straight (and diluted) solution of it with  urlLink Enterobacter aerogenes , and then plated it with various agars. Violet Red Bile Agar (VRBA) takes 24 hours to incubate, so I was able to check my results to day.

12032161,Male,27,Law,"       What an inspirational morning! It appears to resemble a cross between Eastern Europe 1989 and Paris 1944. Either one works, though of course the fall of communism is much more fresh in our collective memories. Plus that statue felled in Baghdad was rather Stalinesque. Wow. Of course, the wonderful commentary on CNN and MSNBC points out repeatedly that there's still a lot more to do - almost, it seems, attempting to marginalize the significance of the moment. In fact, completely missing the significance.     While true that we have mopping up to do, the fact that we are watching a people, who have been completely oppressed for over a generation, taste real freedom for the first time, well, it just makes your heart jump and your spine tingle. At least it does mine. This is awesome. The followup, impromptu rally in Dearborn, MI of Iraqi expats is equally compelling. The naysayers, the shortsighted analysts, are wrong. They will still be employed tomorrow, though, which is sad.     Freedom is chronically discounted by the realpolitik and liberal establishments. Why, I don't know. Just imagine, if you will, the Middle East today if this had happened in 1991. The complexion would be much improved, and democracy may be more widespread. This is only the beginning.

Now we might make Sadr part of the government and allow the Mahdi Army to be incorporated into the Iraqi security forces.  Check out  urlLink The New York Times: Several Iraqis Dead After Clashes With U.S. Near Najaf .  That's just brilliant.  The various Iraqi insurgencies are 2 for 2 now.  You think they might get the idea that if you fight the Americans, you get what you want?  Thanks to Bush's disasterous policies, the military was put in a Catch-22.  Continuing to fight merely pisses more people off and strengthens the insurgency.  Caving in (the better option, and the one chosen for once) encourages the militants and rewards them for spreading mayhem.    So how is all this ad hoc bargaining going to affect the post-handover government?  Will Fallujah be a self-governing enclave?  Will Sadr, thanks to his private army, be the de facto ruler of southern Iraq?  Does Bush have his head up his ass?  Hint: at least one of these questions has a definitive affirmative answer.  Of course, the administration continues to ignore these major problems in its public statements.  Listening to Bush's speech the other night (or reading excerpts, as I did, because listening to his monkey ass makes my blood boil), and his simple '5-step plan,' you'd think that none of this stuff had ever happened.

The different 'types' of Jesus noted in the article:  Manly Jesus (Warrior Jesus) Rocky Jesus (This is Mel Gibson's Jesus) Historical Jesus Blue-State Jesus  On BSJ:   In his recent book American Jesus, Stephen Prothero shows how early 20th-century proponents of a masculine Jesus were reacting to the feminine, Queer Eye for the Christ Guy portraits of Jesus that were popular in the 19th century. Prothero points to the absurdly womanish, wide-hipped Jesus of El Señor, Andando Sobre el Mar (Christ Walking on the Sea) as perhaps the best example. In the 21st century, feminine Jesus lives on as the ultimate sensitive man. South Park mocks this Jesus: Its Christ hosts a Donahue-style talk show called Jesus and Pals.   This is Blue-State Jesus, a pacifist Democrat who drives a hybrid vehicle while advising people to cheerfully render their taxes unto Caesar. Blue-State Jesus is an antiauthoritarian hippie who judges not lest he be judged. ('Following a set of rules doesn't make us the Father's children,' grooved one 1960s San Francisco Bay Area group cited by Prothero. 'It's digging on the relationship with Him.') A few years back, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals launched a Blue-State Jesus campaign when they tried to convince Americans that the Lamb of God didn't eat meat. Blue-State Jesus might be black or gay. He dislikes organized religion. He's more economic radical than sexual conservative. Sure, he opposed divorce and adultery, but didn't he save an adulteress from a stoning? Blue-State Jesus was the driving force behind abolitionism and the civil rights movement but not the pro-life or temperance movements. Heck, he's Party Jesus—he turns water into wine just to keep the night rockin'.   I still think that BSJ=Buddy Christ=Eddie Murphy from 'Holy Man'          ",2004-08-08

12032171,Female,39,Consulting,"           Was considering calling him to make sure he was alive.  Figuring a likely time that he would be out, just checking for voicemail.  But, what is the point?  The thing that is hard is that I figured that one way that it would all swing was that I was just a woman to him.  And that there was a pattern of attitude and behavior that said that he thought women were just a mm above worthless.  And worth only sex and I knew that I was not going to be worth that to him, so I would, if only a woman, be worthless to him and that he would walk, like he has.  And what others say of him and what I found there certianly suggest that all of that is true.  And, so I struggle to find ways for it not to be.  I thought that maybe I was worth more than that, that I was not a woman to him, but a friend.  So, to think that I invested years, tens of thousands of dollars,  and all of the other discarded choices in my faith in him is just kind of stunning.  I had thought that over time my relationships were getting better, more intelligent, stronger emotionally.  But, this moment is the worst ever.  I really can conceive of no way for him to be gone and to have ever cared at all.  The two just do not compute for me.  I do not understand.  If I am supposed to learn to never trust, never be open, never want to tether my life to another, then OK, I do not need to understand.  The why and how does not really matter.  I wish that I felt a little more certain about what next steps to take in my life.  Tomorrow is the big decision day.    I suppose that living in a big city has its advantages.  Opportunity to be nameless and faceless.  I could spend the time to rest and get stronger.  I could return to swimming and meditation.  Find book groups and meditation groups and perhaps a religious group that might not weekly annoy me.  Find something to volunteer to eventually.  And maybe find the time and place to see friends once a year.  It would be a different life, but one that might over time allow me to be stronger.  The question become just one of can I do it at all.  I think that I will wait until I am gone, then call.  If by then I still want to know that he is OK.         ",2004-08-02

Good news was that I started work late today, so the long morning was really nice. It was snowing like mad when I left this afternoon. It's a  good thing I gave myself a bit of extra time, because I got held up by an accident scene, then farther up the road, all the traffic lights were out at some major intersections.

12032176,Male,25,Consulting,"           Sometimes people tend to find out that how they deal with their own selves is evident of how they deal with others.   A good example is moi. I feel as though I'm a bit of a perfectionist. I always end up giving myself a tough time when I don't achieve what I want to achieve. I'm very hard on myself when I feel like I can't deliver something I've set my goals on.   This kind of pressure on me has somehow been exhibited on the expectations I have of people around me. Maybe not in the exact same way but more of I expect people to be their best. This is one thing I have yet to get rid of.   Earlier today I heard on the radio that a writing competition was opened for budding writers of novels, shorts stories, etc. I immediately thought of  urlLink Jagard . He comes to mind simple because I think and feel that his writing is most unusual to me. I have constantly noted how much of a writer he is and always remind myself that he is one talented guy. After informing him of the competition, I was initially excited that he showed some form of curiousity about how to join the contest. After sending him a message containing info of what I got from the radio commercial, he sent back a message that really got me to sigh. (as he expected). He expressed concerns of not being able to be at par with the other particpants and all that stuff. Initially, I was aback by that statement, thinking 'why would that be his initial frame of mind'. It never made me understand why there are people who just end up thinking bad thoughts about probable endeavours.  Lucky for me, I just underwent training that helped me understand where Jagard was coming from. When I found the time to drop him a line, I immediately took the chance. What I got from the conversation was that his main concern is not to perform well and not liking the whole experience. He's also saying something about his preference of knowing that a number of people find his way of writing very impressive rather than knowing that he would not fair well in a competition.   I guess it was also hard for me to understand that because I'm a person who's gone through so many competitions since I was young. Elementary, High School, College and even now at work. Academic, Non Academic, name it and i've probably joined it once. That's most of the reason why I'm not seeing Jagard's point of view. I reason I've participated in so many competitions is because of my motivation to succeed all the time and just beat the hell out of the others.

12032177,Male,24,Consulting,"       I finally joined the gym last week, paid RM362, and Rm140 monthly for the next 12 months. Good good. Right, so i was like driving back from Great Eastern Mall where i met with a auto accident. It wasn't anything serious. I mean like.. after the first big bang in 98, this is  nothing to worry about. I drive a proton wira, malaysia's national car, i have my gripes with it, it gets me from point A to B. Fine.. But it's so fucking fragile. One bump and everything goes loose. Proton cost cuts and butt fucks the malaysian public, by producing inferior quality cars. The Government overprices non national makes through a rigid tax structure, making Japanese, Korean and european makes out of reach from the average joe like me. Anyway, damages = bonnet kemek, bumper kemek, chassis kemek a bit, front grill gone.. Total cost i have to spend on repair bills = RM800.  Lemme enlighten u on how this went down. It was at a T-junction. Some asshole, sped thru a red light, forcing the car in front of me to do an emergency brake, forcing me to do an emergency brake as well, but i couldn't brake on time, so i rear ended the kelisa in front of me. Damage on the kelisa was quite minimum, i would say cost of repairs RM400 plus.. The dude who sped the red light stopped, then after some negotiations, left. ( i will decline to elaborate) But the kelisa dude also left cos he was flabbergasted. So, i was gonna lodge a report, which must be within 24 hours. If the kelisa dude doesn't lodge, i won't too, and fix the car by myself.  So, next story, i am now contemplating as to whether to go out for my usual saturday nite out, or not. What i have is 3 concerns.  no. 1 = Cost.. i am like gonna be spending RM800 soon. no. 2 = I will have to use my mom's car, which i am reluctant to do so. no. 3 = I don't feel like drinking today. I love liquor, but not today.  With that being said, if any lovely ladies (colleagues) do ask me to go, i might hessitate for a bit, then probably will go. Another thing is parking. I am thoroughly familliar with my car, the dimensions and all, but not so much with my mom's car, hence the hessitancy. We'll see how it goes la.  So, how you might ask is it going with my conquest? Well, she still views me as too young, i suppose. If i take her view point, that would be true. So, like i said, i need to grow up as fast as possible. Procastinator should be my name! hehehe I truly need to be kicked to do work or at least get started.  Hmm... enuff for today.          ",2004-08-07

Just doesn't happen any more, they will say.   I contend that it isn't that the issue is dead at all, but that we don't notice it any longer. Part of the culture now, it slinks in under the radar.  That agendas can be put forward by language, and what language is disallowed, should be obvious by now. Or is it obvious, really?  Here is a short list of words and images, according to Diane Ravitch, that editors and writers of school textbooks  are required  to avoid.  'snowman' -  BANNED  replaced by 'snowperson.' 'senior citizen' -  BANNED  marginalizes older people. 'jungle' -  BANNED  replaced with 'rain forest.' 'blind leading the blind' -  BANNED  as 'handicapism.' 'polo' -  BANNED  as elitist. 'senile' -  BANNED  as demeaning. 'Founding Fathers' -  BANNED  sexist. 'fairy' -  BANNED  replaced with elf.  You can't depict men as 'active problem solvers' or working with tools.

12032184,Male,26,Automotive,"       So, I'm at the post office here recently, and I see this very annoying lady that works out at the same gym I do.  As usual, she pretends no one else is in the room.  This gnome of an old lady is probably one of the most rude people I have ever met.  I would suspect she's from Canada and sports a John Kerry Flip Flop - Oops! - I meant to say sticker - on her car.  She's so rude that I was using a machine the other day and she comes over and says 'I need to use this space right here, and I'm going to need to use it now. Okay?'  Well, it wasn't okay but it was way too early in the morning to be rude to an old lady.  She only needed the spot I was in so she could see herself to curls (with no weight) in the mirror.  Now that you have some background - back to the story at hand.  She's at the post office, and she needs a voter registration form.  The guy behind the counter says 'I'm sorry, we normally have them but we're out of them.  They probably won't deliver anymore until tomorrow or the next day.'  Somehow, this doesn't phase her at all.  She looks right back at the man and says 'Well, I need one.'  I guess she expected him to pull it out of his ass - I don't know.  He apologized again, and he honestly didn't have one.  There wasn't really anything he could do - if you don't have one, you just don't have one.  She stood there waiting for someone to go get her one.  Seeing she was holding up the line - the manager came out to see what the problem was, and even called the voting commission to make sure they were bringing them out.  The manager then told her that the voting commission would bring them out first thing in the morning.  I started to think this woman was deaf, but maybe because she's old she thinks everyone owes her something.  She responded by really saying 'So, what do I do now?  I NEED a voter registration card.'  Then, she figures it out, and makes it seem like it was her idea so she says 'Well, it doesn't look like you guys have one, so I'm going to go down to the voting commission and get on there.'  I almost started applauding.  I suppose she thought if she stood there long enough they would give in and hand her one.  What part of 'they don't frickin have one' didn't she understand?  Honestly people - no means no.  If you order a hamburger at a restaurant and they're out of them - don't force the issue.  What you get might look like a hamburger but I can assure you it will not be.    ",2004-08-03
12032185,Male,26,Automotive,"       Howdy folks! it seems about a week since i last bloggin' ere. Nothing new, just wandering when i should be going back to malaysia. its been about more than 5 months ive been outstationed here, but at least i got to stay in a very good apartment... very good indeed. very easy to get around, near the historic tower bridge (every day cross that bridge to go to work). Catch a train at Fenchurch Street and off me go to Basildon, where all the challenge lies... To be honest, being outstationed for such a long time is very tiring indeed. I'm really hoping for a good trip back in Malaysia, eventhough immediately kena stationed plak kat Gurun, again. but only for a couple of weeks and then walah! holiday bebeh! kat mana lagi kalu tak at my parent-in-law house at lovely Telok Kalong beach at Kemaman. Very nice place! i would recommend that if u all want something different but near enought to Cherating, which is just 20-30mins drive (under the speed limit i would guess). And after that? probably attend the compulsory training for me to be upgraded. To be honest, im not attending the training just for the sake of 'going' only, but thouroughly i've enjoyed it. Thats maybe because its somewhat make alot of sence in relation to my current job. Anyway, its not cheap per training eventhough made internally. So why not make the best of it, right?

12032186,Male,37,Automotive,"             My Dad was in World War II.  He passed away in August 2001, and before and after, I pondered that defining time in his life.  I pondered it after 9/11, when people suddenly became super patriots, flags everywhere, spouting off about subjects they knew next to nothing about, emotions overtaking what sense they may or may not have had in the first place.  I read an  urlLink excerpt  from a book that sounds like it asks some good questions, and has some interesting things to say, called   urlLink Homeland  .  In it, it questions why people react the way they do to defining events.  I love and appreciate America, but I also feel many actions we do can and has been wrong.  We that live here should always question what's going on.  If that makes me a troublemaker, then so be it.  My Dad loved America too, laying his life on the line many times during WWII.  He came back quietly as most men did, no parades, no fanfare.  He didn't fly a flag either, but neither did he get angry over it.  He just went on with life.  But one thing he always taught me not by empty words but by his example, is that you do what you can, you work hard, and you DO ask questions.      urlLink MORE…          ",2004-07-02

Otherwise, where would the life necessity KC & The Sunshine Band fit into things? And then there's Press Gang.  Oh Press Gang, how I love thee. I love thee more than life itself. Even more than Rasberry Cola. And I love Rasberry Cola.  Press Gang chronicled the tales of the staff of the Junior Gazette, a group of High School students offered the chance to write, design, edit, and print a weekly junior edition of the local 'Gazette' newspaper. While never a soap opera in the way that a show like this could have been, writer Steven Moffatt created a childrens show that committed the cardinal sin of childrens TV. It's entertaining. The scripts were smart and funny, with a production style that perfectly complimented the concept of the show.  The show was a big part of my early teens, and I've always had a fond spot for the series.

12032190,Male,33,Automotive,"           Something I think about  urlLink Wildside .  Wildside is the sort of drama the ABC should be funding.  I don't mean cop shows or serious dramas.  Wildside was a program that was a little to 'edgy' to succeed on the commercial networks because of their inherent confidence problems and business approach to broadcasting.  I think it is the ABCs role to make up the difference.  Wildside conforms to what John Caldwell describes as televisuality - television where style is brought to the fore as a marker of quality.  Max Headroom, Twin Peaks, the Sopranos and Sex and the City are all examples of Televisuality.  It is often loss leader television and the rise of HBO as a place where televisuality is respected is part of an argument about shifts in television and the acknowledgment of style as a brand - the coming of what Rogers, Reeves and Epstein refer as TVIII - television not necessarily constrained by the broadcast form.  But that's another argument...  Thanks to the funding cuts, the ABC only has the funding to produce one high production drama series per annum, which seems counterproductive when balanced against the claims of the early 00s that the ABC should be measured against ratings success to justify its existence.  The problem with the application of such a model is that the ABC is not rewarded for the production of successful programs, many of which it the ongoing production of which would come at the expense of new productions, and secondly, it makes the ABC nothing more than a govt funded commercial network.  In such a position Aunty has no room to produce programs that are valuable, quality, or just plain good television (like Wildside) that would not be funded by commercial television because of the profit margin system in place.  As Producer Steve Knapman suggests  urlLink here , 'They [the commercial networks] dont have enough true commercialism to be entrepreneurial about breaking ground on their own network.'  Now before we go on to say that the ABC shouldn't be dropping Govt - sorry I mean public funds into productions that only academics and a few geeks who talk about television on the internet will enjoy I would like to pint out that  urlLink SLOU , one of the finest commercially successful dramas of late failed in its first season.  Coming out of  urlLink Big Brother  in 2001 SLOU debuted to mediocre ratings (remember it was test screened to the housemates?).  Ten needed an Australian drama hit with the cessation of their output deals in 1999, the wind up of their remaining product, challenges for their core audience from Seven and Nine, and the abomination that was Above the Law (which was a great show that was marketed badly - more on that another time).  SLOU, the first major Sue Masters project after her high profile shift, needed to be a success for Ten.  Ten gave SLOU an 'oncore' screening, running the program over the summer of 01-02, right on the back of its original wind up and supported by their glossy 'Summer of Love' campaign.  This also meant the program ran pretty much straight into the second series in 02.  The encore screening constructed SLOU as 'the best program we all missed out on the first time', the audience got a second chance to sample the program, the 02 season was a success.    Wildside likewise was a critical and passionately supported success.  It's cancellation points to a questioning of the role of the ABC.  What's wrong with the production of high quality drama that only a few people watch?  Marginal audiences have been the speciality of the ABC since aggregation and equalisation in the 1980s.  But the other question this raises, and this is a discourse present in this post itself, why does successful, commercial television have to be lowbrow?         ",2004-06-17
12032191,Male,17,Religion,"                Isn't it a sad state that the Fascist National forces won the Spanish Civil War? The Loyalists, being the Republican-elected govt., get supported by only Mexico and the USSR, while the US, Britain, and France keep their sympathies at home. I applaud those who went over to aid the Loyalists. I have yet to read much lit on this period (Hemingway's 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' is now on my shelf, unread, but certainly on deck). George Orwell's 'Homage to Catalonia' would be good too. I read a short, interesting excerpt from it where Orwell described himself meeting an Italian peasant. A communist soldier, a simple man, and one fighting against the government of his country to fight for his beliefs. It was interesting to consider that even some Germans and Italians, whose governments were supporting Franco's Nationalist rebellion, were joining the Loyalists to fight the spread of Fascism. It's like the Domino Effect theory in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, but also like the end of that conflict, the 'villanous' form of govt. fought against (Communist) didn't spread beyond far beyond Vietnam. Anywho, and the lack of help from democracies causes the Republican collapse, and Franco's brutal reign goes from 1939-1975; 36 years!

'You cannot allow Satan to speak into your life and tell you that you are going to have a hand-me-down life.'

12032201,Male,36,Fashion,"            Boy I Sure Don't Like Much   By DJ Shovelpants    1. What food do you like that most people hate?   Boy there's probably a veritable assload of foods that I like that most people can't stand, but I'm coming up short here.  I guess I'm going to go with the old Chef Boyardee Ravioli in a can.  For some reason, I find this delicious, yet everyone I know thinks it smells bad and is horrible tasting.  I don't get it.   2. What food do you hate that most people love?   Do you have a half hour?  Here goes:  a. White n' creamy  - I won't eat anything a white and creamy consistency, which includes: sour cream, mayonaisse, cottage cheese, ranch dressing, cream cheese etc.  I don't know why that is, but none of the above foods or condiments sounds good to me.  At all.  b. Fungus  - I will not eat anything resembling a mushroom.  People spend all kinds of money trying to keep athlete's foot at bay, yet people are willing to eat 'shrooms.  Yuck.  I think the thing that creeps me out about fungus is that it's a scary cross between the animal and plant world.  c. Seafood  - Anything out of the water is staying off of my plate.  That includes: tuna (can or otherwise), fish sticks, croppies, crappies, halibut, salmon, shrimp, whatever.  Sorry, but everything in the aquatic world has a real 'dirty water' taste to me.  And shrimp?  Since when does eating maggots or worms from the water sound appetizing?  d. Nuts  - Some people like to gobble up nuts.  Not me.  The only kind I like are peanuts.  Period.  Cashews, walnuts, almonds...ick.  Bad aftertaste.  That enough for now.   3. What famous person, whom many people may find attractive, is most unappealing to you?   Jennifer Garner.  The list is endless, but this horse-face is sticking out like a sore thumb.  I swear, she looks like Melissa Rivers who is easily one of the most disgusting 'personalities' working in the biz today.  What is Jennifer Garner's appeal?  She's very plain, her eyes are too close together, and I think she's one of the shittiest actresses around (besides that black hole of talent Julia Roberts).  Yet...everyone seems to like ol' Jen Garner.  Shit.    4. What famous person, whom many people may find unappealing, do you find attractive?   Sheryl Crow.  I don't know if it's her looks or the complete package, but ol' Sherrie does something for me.  Yeah, she's a little bit older and could definitely benefit from a sandwich or two, but I don't know, I dig her vibe.  Her version of Led Zepplin's D'yer Ma'ker is one song of hers that tickles the cockles...of my heart.   5. What popular trend baffles you?   Those stupid ass walkie talkies cell phones.  Isn't the cell phone enough for you?  No, when you've got to talk to someone immediately, just push a button and open your fat mouth.    'Yeah, Jim are you there?  Over.'   'Yeah, Scott.  Go ahead for Jim.'   'Uh, Jim I can't seem to find the plunger and...'   'Oh yeah, Scott.  It's behind the...'   Annoying.  Infinitely annoying.  As if it wasn't bad enough that we have to hear one half of someone's conversation when they're talking on their cell phone, now we have to hear two assholes acting like their driving freight down the highway.  Some dick in my firefighting class had one and was talking to some shitheel IN THE MIDDLE OF CLASS!  Nice guy, but I wanted him dead and his walkie-talkie smashed to pieces. ---------- Bass Babe - About the low pants: yeah, definitely trying to hard.  These pigs usually have a tattoo above their crack in close proximity.  'You like my ass?  No?  How about the tattoo instead?'  Sorry ladies.  No.  PB - What happened with Lee Jeans?

12032203,Male,36,Fashion,"             I just cut a hole in my sock.   Actually I didn't cut it personally--I was walking around, and it snagged on the baseboard heater and ripped a hole in it. Do any of you people have any funny sock stories?  This is my funny sock story. Here, at home, the floors are always really dirty. On a good day I will get only a little bit of gunk on my socks, but there will be crumbs, and on a bad day the bottoms will turn  BLACK . I wear white socks. Anyway, this means that by the end of the day my socks are filthy. So, when I went to montreal and ottawa i was AMAZED at how clean the floors were. Anyway, I was wearing my usual socks when I was in Montreal, and I changed them every day. Then we got on the train from Montreal to go to ottawa. THat night when I was at my Grandmothers house I was taking off my socks so that I could go to bed, and I noticed that they were completely clean. 'Hmmm' I thought 'It would be fun to be able to wear my socks for 2 or 3 days in a row.' So I did. Then didn't get sweaty, because I don't get sweaty feet, and they stayed clean. In the end I wore them for 4 days. They went through 4 cities. First I wore them in Montreal. Then I wore them in Ottawa. Then I wore them in Frederiction, and finally I wore them in Halifax. After a day in halifax they had to be changed. I also went through Trois Riveres, and a bunch of other towns with those socks on. They are a pair of very special socks.   When I got back, I called my friend to tell her all about my trip. When I was finished telling her everthing I finally said 'And I got to wear my socks 4 days in a row!'   'Nice'   was her sarcastic answer. Am I just crazy????!         ",2004-05-23

This of course was a stupid thing to think as this morning I've been running around like a little piggy set on fire.  Of course my job has made me more susceptible to feeling hard done by when actually faced with work; however please believe me when I say I was being over-worked.  Even better was that there was a group of repeat students on the steps of my building waiting for their exams. There was actually a problem with their room which required me to repeatedly run between my building and another neighboring building to get keys etc to sort out the room. There I was running - like Small Ball of Fire after Orlando Bloom - trying to sort something out for them; and they think it is a funny joke.

12032212,Male,26,Publishing,"             Andrew, over at his  urlLink Bedsit Bomber blog , is still digesting the results of the council elections, and musing on the Blair problem. Do we want rid of him now? After the election? At all? Michael Moore thinks he knows the answer, and has announced that his next film will concentrate on Blair's role in the Iraq war.    He likens Blair  'to an older sibling of Bush's'  and says that,  'as a parent, when two children get in trouble, the parent usually questions the older one as to how he or she could let such a problem occur'.  Blair knows better, he says. Blair is not an idiot.  'So what is he doing hanging around with this guy?' . You can read more (well, essentially exactly what I've just re-hashed),  urlLink  here.

12032214,Male,26,Publishing,"             Went to see Fahrenheit 9/11 at last today, and thought it was absolutely magnificent; many many times better than Bowling For Columbine and really moving in places, although also really infuriating. I keep reading, mind, that people object to Moore's brand of 'propaganda' but I don't mean that is what infuriates; rather the cheerful, bloody and smug ignorance of the Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld/Rice collective. If at times the fratboy Bush is almost likeable on the Golf course he is never anything but a disgrace elsewhere; his blase attitude just stunning. At one point, pressed on where Bin Laden is he remarks,   'And he's just, he's, he's a, he's a person who's now been marginalized, so, I, I don't know where he is, nor... and I just don't spend that much time on it, Ellie, to be honest with ya'   Um. Right.  Elsewhere, Moore notes,   'While Bush was busy taking care of his base and professing his love for our troops, he proposed cutting combat soldiers pay by 33% and assistance to their families by 60%. He opposed giving veterans a billion dollars more in health care benefits, and he supported closing veteran hospitals. He tried to double the prescription drug costs for veterans and opposed full benefits for part-time reservists. And when Staff Seargeant Brett Petriken from Flint was killed in Iraq on May 26th, the army sent his last paycheck to his family, but they docked him for the last five days of the month he didn't work, because he was dead.'   Where this film succeeds is where Bowling for Columbine failed. This time round, Moore has put together a riverting and cogent narrative. Having started with the phoney election, Bush's Saudi links and the 'war' in Afghanistan (he notes that only 11,000 ground troops were sent in, and it was  two months  before they reached Bin Laden's base) it seems natural that the film will turn its attention to Iraq. Yet Moore pulls away and begins to talk about the culture of fear in America (something he didn't quite iron out in his last film), and - in the film's best sequence - about poverty in the States, about how the army represents the best option for the disenfranchised of, say, (and here Moore finally shambles into view) his beloved Flint, Michigan. The film begins to wander...  But does it? Moore's structure is genius; when he moves, finally, on to Iraq he has done something documentary makers the world over would kill to do - he provides a marvellous contextual backdrop to the film's thesis:  the young men and women of America who enlist into our armies (he says) are willing to fight and die for their country. They fight so we don't have to. They die so we don't have to. The only thing they ask of us is that we only send them into harm's way when it absolutely necessary.   The people he finds, listens to and interviews are ordinary Americans. Yes, he knows how to tug the heartstrings (his use of Arvo Part's 'Cantus in Memory of Benjamin Britten' as we see footage of 9/11 is wrenching, with that wonderful, chiming bell resonating through the cinema) but the film is not carried by the weight of his argument, or the bias of it. It is carried by the stories he tells. His surprisingly masterful direction is the icing on the cake.   A really super film, and it made me as angry as hell.          ",2004-07-12
12032215,Male,33,Publishing,"        What Happened to Eduard Shevardnadze?   Back in the day Crazy  Eddie Shevardnadze  was our boy -- remember that? He was down with  James Baker  and  George Bush the Elder  and even Ambassador  Vernon Walters , who used to quip that he could speak eight languages and think in none (too true, Vernon;  too true ).   Now, after two dozen years in power, Shevardnadze fell in for the old autocratic desire for unlimited power. Tant pis. But how did Shevardnadze go from being down with  those Fabulous Baker boys , all presiding over the fall of the Soviet Union into being a petty tyrant from a tiny backwater?  As a rule of thumb,   The Corsair  believes that no head of state, no matter how good, should stay beyond ten years in power.   Now, if  The Corair  could be a benevolent autocrat he would make a modified Great Books education mandatory for all public school kids :  Archimedes  and  Euclid  and  Ptolemy  Math labs; piano keyboard lessons with music appreciation featuring  Monteverdi  and  Bach  and  Beethoven  and  Coltrane ; intensive biology labs with  Harvey  and  Gray's Anatomy , supplemented by freehand drawing and painting of the torso and organs;  African dance  to get the blood flowing; kindergarteners can imitate and learn of cave drawings with charcoal; comparative world religions and myths for the kids' curiositas; and readings of the  Analects of Confucius  and Sun Tzu's Art of War and  Machiavelli's Discourses on Livy   and  Clausewitz'   On War  for political science as well as reading of the  Lincoln-Douglas  debates and the US Consitution.

12032220,Male,27,Publishing,"       Technically, I'm still on holiday - of which I'll share all the highlights at some later point in time - but there was one thought that struck me last night that I wanted to share right away. &nbsp; Assumption: reasonable understanding of Einstein's theory of  urlLink Special Relativity . &nbsp; One of the consequences of this theory is what is called the twin paradox:&nbsp;One of a&nbsp;twin flies off in a spaceship travelling near the speed of light. When he returns he discovers that his twin has aged much more rapidly than he has (or he aged more slowly). Now, this made me wonder... Crank up your trusty  urlLink SL1200 , and supercharge it a bit. Well, a bit... Make sure it turns at such a speed that the edge speeds along at nearly the speed of light. Got that? Good. Now, switch it off, stand on it, in such a way that your left leg is at the centre of the thing, and your right leg near the end. You got it: now switch it on! I really do wonder what the effect of this would be (apart from being flung off at a spectacular speed, that is). Any thoughts, let me know... &nbsp; -E     ",2004-07-17

12032222,Female,34,Marketing,"                 I left alot out in my previous posts,like my mom breaking my arm twice as I was in her way, The grapic details of what 'He' did to me.Alot of details of my marriage. He had a gambling and drinking problem,we often would not have money for groceries,and I would have to go to local food pantry. But,I always found a way to make sure my kid's had what they needed. He was a total control freak. I could not have any friends,he would call me at work several times during the day to make sure I was there. If the house was not spotless,he would let me have it later. If he was not given sex,it was hell to pay,so to protect us I would just lay there and cry until it was over. He held me up against the wall by my neck one day because I wanted to take the kids to a carnival,and he did not feel like going since he had been out all night.I was going to take them by myself and he freaked. My kid's were right there,and my son who was about 6 at the time,started kicked him and screaming at him to let his mom go. I was soon afterwards that he started telling me that if I ever left him,that he would take the kids and run. And I would never see them again.And that if he couldn't have me no one would.He would often tell me I was ugly,no man would want me ect ect. I became very depressed and finally went to the doctor,they wanted to put me in the hospital that day as they thought I was suicidial.But somehow I convinced them that I would never leave my kids,and they put me on 3 different types of meds. To this day I'm still on two. Gawd It feels like it's going to take me forever to get brought up to date to today.So many things happened after the divorce.So many nights of drinking myself to a stupor when he came and got the kids. Calling into work for 3 days at a time as the depression had set in so bad I couldn't even go out of the house. Financially I was in big trouble.Could not get help from the state,so would have to borrow money to pay the rent or buy groceries. My son is bipolar. I didn't find out what was wrong with him until after I left his dad as I was always told 'there is nothing wrong with him,it's YOU,if you can't handle your own son then that is your fault. He would go into a rage for no reason,but then I could handle him,just putting him in a bear hug sitting on the floor with him and holding him down until it passed. Sometimes it would be an hour. But after the divorce it got much worse. He is a big kid,right now is 6'3 and weighs 210 and is only 14. I'm 5'7 and weigh 117 when I've been eating right. During the first year,he was always in a rage,going as far as throwing me against the wall,or throwing me down on the floor and jumping on me and try to strangle me until my daughter would jump on his back. I finally knew I couldn't do it anymore when I went into his room one morning to wake him for school,he woke up,grabbed a baseball bat and missed my head my an inch.I called the police,and they told me to get him to the hospital if I was able. I lied to him and said we were going to get breakfast before school. The whole drive there I kept thinking that they were going to say I was a bad mom,take him away from me ect ect. But once there it took 4 security guards to get him out of the car,then 6 nurses and 2 doctors to strap him to the bed. Then,they called me into a private room,and asked me what he has been doing.I told them everything. The doctor called in a nurse,and gave me a gown,and asked me to put it on. I was very confused,but did it anyway (still hearing my son screaming and saying he was going to kill everyone there in the hallway). When they came back into the room they asked me to let them see the bruises. I was horrified,shocked, I showed them,and hadn't even realized how bad they were.From months of being thrown around,hit,shoved,things thrown at me.I had black and blue marks all over my body.They took pictures,and told me that he has a severe mental problem.That they feel he is a threat to himself and us,and that they were going to send him to a mental facility for evaluation.FINALLY someone knew,someone believed me and I was going to get help. Or I thought anyway. He was there for a week,they gave him anti depressants and sent him on his way. We went to counseling every week,but the meds were not working,I kept telling the DR he's not getting better please help me. The police have been called to our apt several times and they said if they come back again they are taking him. They would walk in,and look right at him and say' what did you do to your mom now'. They knew,they saw,but I begged and pleaded with them not to take him. I had promised him on one of his 'good days' that we would get thru this and no matter what no one was going to take him from me. He would not be put in a juvienelle home. Maybe a mental hospital for help,but that would be the last extreme. After going thru several doctors,I went in for my own appt with my Dr for my meds,and was reading a health magazine,and there was a huge articile about bi-polar.I was able to check yes to the 50 questions of symptons. My heart raced,I almost felt like I was going to faint. I brought the article in to my Doctor,and told him everything,and said I'm not getting any help with these others...please help me. He went in front of the medical board the next day to get permission from them to treat my son,telling them that he was being passed from Dr. to Dr. and I needed help now. They gave him the ok,and he has since tried 3 different meds.Each working better and better,just 3 weeks ago he increased the dosage of his current med,and the change is remarkable.He still has a little bit of rages,but not as bad as before. His dad still won't admit his son has a mental problem (bi-polar can come from another family member too,and I think his dad might me also) so he tells his friends he just has ADHD.  I'll post more later        ",2004-08-22

12032227,Male,26,Marketing,"       So S and I went and saw the movie 'The Day After Tomorrow' the day after yesterday (get it?  I'm funny).  It's so refreshing to see a movie with absolutely no political agenda!  Next on the list, Farenheit 9/11!  (kidding of course).  Even though the movie was laced with it's obvious liberal slant, there were some definitely cool aspects.  The special effects showing the different parts of the global climate change were super duper cool!  The huge wave that sweeps over NY is really cool!  They showed clips of it in the trailer, but the actual event in the movie is awesome with the wave consuming large parts of the city!  Oh, and Sela Ward is fucking hot for an older chick.  I'd like to do her the day after tomorrow.  In fact, I think I'm going to use her as the object of my masterbatory thinking the evening before tomorrow morning.

12032228,Male,33,Marketing,"            A few random thoughts today....  Mike Ditka is considering a run for the Senate in Ill.  What?!!,  The last I remembered, he SANK the resurgent Saints with the Monster Ricky Williams debacle.. for those who dont remember, he gave up their entire draft to get Ricky Williams- who almost immediately came into some mental problems, an arrest or two, a Wedding Dress and eventually went on to Fame and Fortune with the Dolphins (but don't worry the Dolphins can't win after Thanksgiving)    ...Jimmy Buffett has a new album called 'license to chill'...REALLY!...  Jimmy Buffett, License to Chill (* * * ) Hearing Buffett's impact on contemporary country music isn't hard: Just listen to any of Kenny Chesney's records and half of Alan Jackson's. Country's influence on Buffett is obvious in his covers of tunes by Hank Williams and Guy Clark. Chesney and Jackson join him for duets, as do George Strait, Toby Keith, Clint Black, Martina McBride and Nanci Griffith. Buffett also uses this platform to showcase the under-appreciated talents of slide guitarist Sonny Landreth, guitarist/songwriter Will Kimbrough and R&B singer Bill Withers. And none of the guests detracts from a Buffett experience; if anything, they bring a little more to the party. —Brian Mansfield  >  ...I wonder who this guy is?

I used to think that May-December romances were vile and gross, but as I'm getting older, I get it. Some women just want someone reliable and dependable: someone who can handle their finances and is ready to settle down; someone who can provide for and take care of a wife and possibly a baby. I mean, who doesn't want the easy life?  Me. Every so often, my mom sighs and reminds me to not marry an older man, like she did. Older men get old, she says, then you have to take care of them. My mom had it hard. She was my dad's nurse for over a decade as he progressed deeper and deeper into Parkinson's disease. She had to spoonfeed him and diaper and wash him and clean up after him and she was barely in her 50s while he was in his mid-60s. I told her XX is 30 and she gasped. She was worried for me. I said, don't worry mom, I'm not gonna MARRY him, but if I do, there's always divorce! I was joking, but I think I gave her a mini-heart attack with that one.  On Saturday, XX took me on a date. He promised awesome food at Thee Parkside, like Hush Puppies and Chicken Fried Steak, but when we went, they'd changed their menu to bar food burger fare. We went to Goat Hill Pizza instead and ate pizza and drank beer. Then we went to a rockabilly show at Thee Parkside. XX knew the doorman so we got in for free which was awesome! It's because I clip coupons and pick up pennies that I was so thrilled.   I'd never been to a rockabilly show before, and it was fun to see all the 50s-styled eye candy -- all the dungarees, the pompadours, and the coiffed made-up ladies with dainty shoes. I felt like a bulldyke with my messy disheveled hair, windbreaker, and bare face. The show was okay, but I ached for the familiarity and comfort of scrawny pasty humble indie types. Maneuvering through a rockabilly crowd is hard, because all the guys are big and assert their stance. At indie shows I tap people lightly on the shoulder and they sway out of the way, but on Saturday, it was like, tap. (No response.) Harder tap. (No response.) TAPTAPTAP! (No response.) Then I had to find an alternate route. To examine things anthropologically, do you think people are attracted to certain scenes because of their physical type? Rockabilly guys are huge!

12032231,Male,36,LawEnforcement-Security,"             I've taken an unexpected break away from the blog, not just writing, but reading.  I'll try to check back up on everyone today.   I am reading a very cool book.  I mentioned it before, but I hadn't started reading it at that time.  I didn't even need to read 'Life on Mars' by Paul Chambers... what a piece of crap.  Everything that was in that book by a real micropaleontologist was in this new book I'm reading in a few paragraphs.  The new book I'm reading is by a spelunker.  (Excuse my spelling on all this)  He's not even a scientist, but he's really done his research and he actually has worked with many of the crucial scientists involved in all this.  He makes me want to drop everything I'm doing and learn how to explore caves and work for scientists exploring life there.  If anyone is interested in by far the largest group of life on earth and the oldest, one which lives deep beneath the earth's surface without oxygen or sunlight, I highly recommend this book.   'Dark Life' by Michael Ray Taylor.  The prospects of life in our solar system other than on Earth seem very good.  The universe must be full of it.  On another view, he also goes into the life around us.  Your body has ten times the amount of organisms living on you as you have actual human cells.         ",2001-09-20

12032235,Male,36,LawEnforcement-Security,"             I also dreamed about owning a Rottweiller the other night that was a bit too aggressive.  I was scared of my own dog.  I was ashamed in front of Jim S. that I couldn't control it better, but my main concern in the dream was that I wasn't being very fair to the dog by having me as an emotional guide.  After waking, I wrote Hank (Chris Hill) the next day talking about my fear that I don't have the wisdom to deal with the seriousness of other people's lives.  The dream stirred something in me. (probably the seriousness of seeing the 9-11 stuff on T.V. again had some part of putting these thoughts in my head.)  The feeling was like waking up the next day after a bad acid trip at a family Thanksgiving gathering, thinking who the fuck am I to be screwing with other people's lives.  Serious, serious, serious.... damn, it's not my job to be a reality fixture for others.  I'm wondering why I'm feeling in the spot light when I really don't have anyone that relies on me in this capacity.  Perhaps being around all these new people at work has something to do with it as well.  After all I just came back from working a job that I had no social contact with others to an environment where I am surrounded by people.  Maybe that's it.  Anyway, cheers to all those self-contained floating souls that might have the same feelings of self-doubt and self-worth or perhaps might actually be concerned for the well being of others.

12032241,Male,24,HumanResources,"       The case of Paradise Hills Medical Center presents a serious ethical problem which faces administrators and providers alike.   On one hand, the physicians' viewpoint of withholding the information in the best interests of the patients seemed acceptable.  Informing the patients may very well cause the patients to refuse treatment that they require, or induce symptoms by the mere suggestion of them.  However, as the story progressed, the underlying issue of the oncology department and hospital as a whole losing business because of the negative publicity this issue would bring, seemed to outweigh the concern for the patients.  In my view, the patients should have been informed of the incident.  It is the responsibility of the hospital administrators, physicians, and other providers to disclose to patients any information regarding their health.  If the outcome would have resulted in litigation, the hospital had already taken an initiative to prove their concern by ordering the resignation of the medical physicist, whose responsibility it was to calibrate the equipment.  The patients have also signed informed consents to authorize the treatment.  If anything, I feel that the outcome would have been positive for the hospital, because they took responsibility for their actions.           ",2004-05-23

We had a nice meal with them, visited, then headed back to Metairie at around 9 p.m.  On the way home, we stopped for a brief visit with my dad since he will probably not be able to visit this weekend for my birthday.  So, this pushed us back to leaving Prairieville/Baton Rouge at 11 p.m.    Did you know that the State Troopers have a number to call to report drunk driving from your cell phone?

12032250,Female,35,HumanResources,"                 Posted on FreeAdvice by me...  Ya know, this whole thing has gotten twisted. I will explain this once again --- simply put.  MIKE is OVER $6,000 in arrears. He has NOT paid support in the last three months.  Support is 406 per month for 2 kids. Arrears is to be paid @an additional $50 per month.  He is SUPPOSED to call on Sunday evenings, HE chooses when and if he calls. I DON'T answer the phone on Sunday evenings. The kids do. WHEN he calls. We have caller ID, so I make a point to let the kids get it. Last summer, he didn't exercise his visitation because HE didn't call to make arrangments. That's fine, they didn't want to go anyways. THEY ARE 15 and a half.   I WILL NOT make my kids get a job to cover the support that their dad is NOT paying. PERIOD. When they work, that money will be for 1. a car. 2 insurance. 3. frivoulous stuff they want. 4. college.  I DO have an income. A seperate income from my husband. Where I work has NOTHING to do with MIKE paying his support. PERIOD. Support was based BOTH of our incomes. HE was in college for 4 or 5 years. Now that he's finished, this means that theoritically he should be able to get a better paying job and then be able to easily pay his support. I'm not in the process of taking him for a modification. I don't want or need that. I just want the support to restart as soon as possible. Just like everybody else on this whole dang board. The kids deserve this support to be coming into our household.  The budget we have is for my FAMILY income. Like I said, the support money is to pay for the extra things that come up in life. Whether it's movies or a huge family meal. And yes, when that support is coming in on a regular basis for a change, YOU get used to it coming in. SO, in turn, you increase your living style. PERIOD. It's not socked away for when he's NOT going to pay. Oh yes, we had some money socked away for a rainy day. BUT, NOT 3 months worth. Yea, I know I should have because I can't depend on MIKE to do the right thing by his kids.  The one thing I got out of all this bs, is that LW has her lil following and they are so gullable to see the lies as truths. Even when the truth is shoved in their faces.  I've proven my point time and again regarding the under handed dealings and **** that they do, and still, you've got her back... So be it...   I did get links to some GREAT sites I will be taking advantage of very soon. And I can't wait.  Oh yea, MY NAME IS JUDY... (how's that?

I would say that I’m not sure what to make of the Senate’s 40-hour talk-a-thon, but realistically, it’s just a big publicity stunt that has wasted time and taxpayer dollars.

12032262,Male,24,Military,"             It has been a while since I have posted, and I know this.  Ever since I came up with the ingenious idea to take online classes, I have spent all day at work (when I am not actively working-most of the shift) on the computer.  For this reason, I avoid mine at home, as if it were the plague, choosing rather to stare at it as if it were my enemy.  Then I wander over, check my email, and see how much money I do not have in the bank.  This is my daily ritual when I get home from work.  Due to the fact that everything is automated, I do not even have to get on the internet, because everything is downloaded and waiting for me; i.e., Outlook, Microsoft Money, Etc.  At any rate, this is why I have not rambled in a good long while.  That, and I do not have much to say of late.  :)  Hmmmm, so what is new.... Not a whole lot really.  I passed my online hell classes, with a 'B' and an 'A', so that made my month; something had to.  Now I am taking Environmental Science, and it is of course much more in depth and difficult than it was advertised to be.  I have essays out the ying yang, as well as really complex online discussions that are entirely over my head.  I do not really care about it, I just want the degree.  Physics was enough fun; environmental science is a waste of my time.  Unfortunately, Dr. A does not share my opinion, and seems to think that the entire class also posses doctorates, same as he.  I am beginning to notice a trend....I sold my car today, so now I am depressed.  Not really, because I can get out of debt now, maybe, but a bit irritated at the whole process, and the fact that I feel like I need to do it.   I am spoiled, and I like my toys.  No toy, however, is worth an $900 a month bill (including insurance and gas, of course).  When the things you own begin to own you, then there is a problem, and it is no longer fun.  I have always had pretty much whatever I wanted, but it has taken its toll on my financial health.  In an effort to redefine and begin anew, decided to say fuck it, bite the bullet, and get out of debt.  Not to mention, everything I have reminds me of a sort of relational hell, so I intend to get rid of all of that as well.  It is a bit liberating, I must say, yet somehow like the death of a small yet irritating pet.  I now intend to get a motorcycle.  Yes, a motorcycle, that is what I will get. :)  My friend is selling me his for a grand, and it is actually really nice.  I do not know what year, but it is a GSXR 900, and I will have fun with it. Motorcycles are much more economical, although there is that fear of a bloody death or maiming, but the way I drive, the probability of such an occurrence was just as good in a car.  Now, I will have to be a bit more careful.  Hold the lectures, please. :)  I have thought of this little paragraph for a couple of weeks now, and still have no good answer.  It is my mandatory bullshit paragraph... :)In the absence of love, there is emptiness, and loneliness.  In the absence of emptiness there is love, but also pain.  To not love is to not fully experience all that a person is and has to offer, or life at all, for that matter,  but to love is to be vulnerable, and that is an unacceptable risk.  Loneliness is the tool of the devil  that sways and convinces the mind of the weak when they are at their lowest point, and then causes them to kick themselves in the ass at a later date.  Emotion complicates life; in the absence of emotion, all is irrelevant, or as they say in German, 'es ist unerheiblich'.  Regret is like a rocking chair.  Back and forth, back and forth, it is something to do, but you go nowhere, and it accomplishes nothing.  Despite the urge and the desire for the miraculous, perhaps sometimes it is better to just leave it alone, and let come what may.  I guess i will find out.So, now I am learning German. Mostly due to the fact that I have been here for 3 years almost, and can say nothing much more than 'Ein bier, bitte' und 'Vas es los, mein hund'.  This is a travesty, so I intend to try to remedy the situation.  It is irritating as hell to try to have a conversation and not have a clue what the hell the other person is talking about.  It took me a week to get my landlord to fix my hot water, and I still have yet to explain that I have not been warm yet, and that is why he will probably never see his deposit that I owe him, still.... :)I am taking a break from the party scene, at least for a weekend.  This is at least my plan, but we will see.  I am coaching Little League Baseball, and we have our first game on Saturday, so I need to have my 'game face' on. :) I never thought I would coach a sport; I suppose it goes right along with my 2 grey hairs I found.  It is tragic.  I have successfully rid my life of distractions to the maximum extent possible, and by that I mean women, and no not anyone reading this (I think)  yet it is still not having the desired affect.  I actually have a female acquaintance that is pretty cool to hang out with, yet she is proving to be more of a distraction than all others combined. I do not know about this; the irony pisses me off.  At any rate,  I find the butchering of the English language in a frustrated and desperate attempt to communicate extremely amusing.  This is saying a lot, because it is generally annoying as hell, and it is good to laugh on occasion.  Not like laughing at someone who stubs there toe, but genuine laughter.  Perhaps it is the grey hair, and I am 'normalizing'?  I seriously doubt it.   I do not think I have ever been in the company of a person who was speaking German,  Russian and English all at the same time, and still not getting their point across.  Funny to me, frustrating for her.  I suppose I could hire a traveling clown to follow me around and amuse me, but this is much more interesting.  :)  German is such a difficult language though.  Supposedly English is easy, but I do not know about that either.Anywho, that is all that I will write for now.  I know I am a slacker, and I will attempt to at the very least be on here once a week.  It is quite amusing to read what you guys post for comments though.  All apologies for seemingly falling off the planet as well. :)  After all, what is the point of a forum devoted to random stupidity if I never post. ;)  To quote my favorite movie, 'Do not take life to seriously, you will never get out alive'...write that down.  Read 'The Art of War' too, if you get the chance; it is really quite interesting. Those Chinese really did think a little much about that kind of thing- pretty amazing that it is so old, and yet still referenced in the various war colleges.  Classics.... ;)P.S.This email is devoid of any hidden meaning, innuendos, and implication....and if there is anything in here that can be taken as either insulting or funny, I meant it as the latter.  If it is in bad taste however, there is not much I can do about that with the exception of having a lobotomy. That is for all of my female readers, by the way.  He he :)           ",2004-04-28

12032269,Male,37,Military,"       I have found,  and for selfish reasons,  that the reporting of the war in Iraq misses some of the most important stories and reports non-events.  In Baghdad any event goes over as the start of the Iraqi Tet Offensive.  Some of the most useless reporting comes from the reporting of so-called controlled explosions.  A controlled explosion is where a piece of unexploded ordinance,  an enemy mortar or rocket,  is blown under supervision of EOD.  These happen in every city and town where Coalition forces are stationed.  Here in Mosul we have the Mad Mortarman.  About once a week he moves around the city dropping round within 200 meters of the base,  rarely do they cause damage.  Watching the news you would think that not only does the war only happen in Baghdad but the rest of the country sits by the pool drinking pomegranate juice.  Also it is not as bad as the media makes out but it's still war.  No soldier will ever admit to that because he wants to tell the 'I'm a hero'  stories when he gets home.  The Northern region of the country has its fighting but Fallujah and Baghdad are the darlings.  By doing this selective reporting they 1. keep reporters in an easy location and 2. make you think it's much worse than it actually is.  The war reporting as it is now shorts all the Servicemen in this theater who are not in the two darling cities.  Another problem is the impression of total breakdown of relations with the Iraqi people.  In the months I have been here I have had only a few incidents where someone has said a cross word to me and most of them were children not aware of the meaning.  Talk to the majority of Iraqis and they will tell you they are glad the war eliminated the Ba'ath party and Saddams 23 million man slave ring.  This is a country added to the list of nations that the people in many years will say, 'I remember when the Americans came to liberate us'.  Aside from the reasons we came in, WMD's,  the UN,  Bush's revenge for Dad,  all Joe (slang for any soldier) knows is that he was part of a liberation of a people and the removal of a despot,  and that is the kind of war ALL soldiers want to be a part of.  The American people have been spoonfed the news of this war in a way that makes the Left think it's a disaster,  the Right proclaim victory,  and the soldiers wondering what the fuck is happening everywhere but in their corner.  The facts are that most Iraqis love us,  some hate us,  Iraq is far from over,  and in the end historians will judge the right and wrong of this war.  All I know is the people are free and Saddam is going to hang for his crimes.  Remember,  up until the war started the entire world hated Saddam until it was time to get bloody.    WMD's were a fact to ALL politicians until we didn't find them.  The Al-Qaida connection has been found for those of you who didn't hear we have captured many operatives here,  I have been there.  Screw politics and the nay-sayers on both sides these people are free and it's up to them to want to keep it.    ",2004-06-30
12032270,Male,48,Military,"                  urlLink White House rejects calls for change of stem cell policy :  'In 2001, Bush signed an executive order limiting federally funded research to 78 lines of embryonic stem cells then in existence. However, researchers say the number of lines actually available is now 19 -- and contamination may make those unusable'  There's just no reason in my mind for not expanding on this research. Everything I have read so far has described outstanding and remarkable developments in the use of stem cells.  I think President Bush is making a huge mistake by not already getting on-board with support of those scientists working to save lives using stem cells. Unfortunately, if he were do do it now it would look like campaign grandstanding on the memory of President Reagan and that would make it a political hot potato instead of just a good idea that needs to be supported.

I got a Liberal Minority (possibly coalition) with the NDP.  I have no idea what this new parliment is going to do for another year or two.  I've already heard that NDP might want cabinet posts.  This means that the Liberals are actually going to have to deliver on the promises they made during the campaign when it comes to social issues.  This is a big spectrum of stuff:  1. strenghten the gun registry (does this mean putting MORE money into it?) 2. more money for health care (does this mean the feds and provs will overlap more and double spend more?) 3. endorse same-sex marriage (does this mean retracting the question from the Supreme Court and actuallying doing your job as a parlimentarian and actually pass legislation?) 4. no capital punishment (was this ever really going to happen anyway?) 5. abortion is legal (does this mean it was illegal and legislation has to be passed or just status quo?) 6. pot delegalised (does this mean just doing what they were going to do anyway?) 7. electoral reform (liberals will NEVER do this even if they get in bed with the NDP) 8. curb spending on the military (how much more on curbing? like stop clothing them?) 9. give money to Chester Nova Scotia (Martin promised it in desparation yesterday) 10. give money to Saskatoon Saskatchewan (Goodale already wants more Agriculture burueacracy there) 11. give money to Fredericton, New Brunswhick (for highways and pot-holes which is a prov thing) 12. give money to Toronto for a variety of reasons and projects (waterfront, hot house, stadium etc..) 13. give money to Vancouver, British Columbia (drugs, olympics, more drugs etc..) 14. give money to Montreal, Quebec (for being liberal..something I don't know!) 15. give money to Chicotomey, Quebec (tax centre, golf courses, employ people) 16. give money to Outremont, Quebec (humm...lawn maintenance, more protection etc..) 17. nationalise the railway (which was a conservative idea to begin with - ironic bonus points)  Well, it is a minority government - hopefully nothing will get done.

12032274,Male,25,Government,"       You hear major league basketball, baseball et al players talk about  'being in the zone ' and ' finding the groove ' and such where you just feel so comfortable with what you're doing that you have no fear that what you are doing is going to go through the bucket, hit the homerun, score the touchdown, etc. In a bit of an epiphony yesterday I realized how true it is. Some of my Ultimate teammates were talking about their inability to dive for a disc, or feeling pressured to throw the disc before they need to / have a good target or don't feel like they are doing much when they defend a player.  The mentality I get on the field is that if I can touch it, I'm going to catch it. I may not knock down the disc from the thrower every time, but I'm going to do it a lot and if I can't manage that I am going to make them change the throw they want to do. Some would call if cockyness, I'd say confidence. Confidence that I know I play the game well enough that I will make things happen.  A lot of my teammates have asked how I catch so many discs and why I dive so much? One question answers the other...I can get to more discs to catch because I dive for them, without thought on the matter I get my hands / upper body in a position to catch the disc more often than another person might. When a disc is thrown ahead of me (within reason) I don't stop running or slow down, I know the disc will slow and hover and give me an opportunity to catch it.  As an offensive player you never take your eyes off the disc. As a defender, you should never take your eyes off of me ;)         ",2004-06-09

We go to this other store, where incedently they make our patches for our suits... $25... same jacket... no differences.... man I love the shopping here. Don't love anything else, but at the least the shopping is cheap. I also found a place that will MAKE me a leather Dallas Stars jacket for $140. Yes, full up dimensions and everything. Very nice. I have seen some of his other stuff and he does a good job too. They take pride in their work here which is much different then many people you find in the US. If I go there on an off day and am the first one in the shop I could probably get the jacket for about $115. They have a superstition about not making a sale on the first person in their shop for the day. Also, a very bad time to return something.

First of all, diesel fuel gels when it gets cold, making it extremely difficult to start the bus' engines.  And once they're finally running, they take  forever  to warm up -- usually more than an hour -- so heat generally becomes a luxury (unless we break the law by running the engines constantly).  Second, wind and high-profile vehicles  definitely  don't mix.  With each gust that hits the bus, the driver has to compensate by counter-steering to maintain a semi-straight path.  These buses are so wide, there's isn't a lot of room to drift before the bus drifts into the next lane.  And that happened several times today.  One gust hit my bus so hard near the Boston University Photonics Building, I drifted about five feet into the next lane, even though I was over-steering against the wind.

A and B grade started together but we took off and left them behind pretty quickly. Actually, when i say we, i mean the rest of A-grade took off and i held on. There were only 5 of us and that meant there was nowhere to hide. We were going flat out and I started taking turns, albeit short ones. Rain and wind prevailed throughout the entire race.  There were 2 guys in the bunch that were heaps stronger than the rest and occasionally (or was it frequently?) one of them would take off and get a gap on us. Then it was even harder. Same workload and 1 less person to do it. It seemed like we spent the entire race chasing someone.  At the end of the first lap (25km) i was just happy that I was still with them. Second lap was harder. One of the strong guys got away and the other strong guy stopped taking turns. That was really ticking me off. We eventually caught the breakaway with about 4km to go. We went over Blood Hill and he took off again. With 2km to go one of the other guys dropped off the back and so three of us tried to chase.   This time I was skipping turns. I was shattered but wanted to make sure I was with them at the end. At some point we realised that we weren't going to catch the break, probably about 500m out and we began sizing each other up. Still I just wanted to make sure I didn't get dropped, even this close to the line. The sprint started but I kinda got blocked or at least I nearly ran up the back of one of the other two, braked a little and never really got up to speed again. I suppose the near miss caused me to panic. If I had just swung around him instead maybe I would have been able to get past. There was a bike length in it and I was utterly spent!  I can only hope that with a bigger bunch I will be able to hide a little more often! Average speed was 38kph over the 50km. Not comparable to tdf stats but a big jump up for me. It's a pity really that I will only get 2 more scratch races up there this season.

In preparation of the upcoming arrival of the grand tea master Sensei wants us all to get a feel of which pieces go well together and complement each other. Reminded me of Christmas, he brought in a box of boxes, the boxes within were of many sizes and wrapped in clothes. I sat back and watched as Sensei peeled the layers of wrapping from the surprisingly precious contents. First the outer clothe was untied and slide free of the wooden box within. These wooden boxes were made with extraordinarily skilled hands, flawless. The tops were tied on with thick durable laces that felt good between the fingers and the knots they employed to hold the boxes in check were an art in themselves. Thin rice paper lay cleanly between the laces and the lid of the box, I believe to protect the box against careless scratches from nails while untying the lace. With the lid clean one only need remove the newspaper stuffing in order to take out the artifact that lay within. Wow, this is quite a job when you have twenty some individually rapped pieces to unpack. The more complex the wrapping the more precious the article within, at one point I watched Sensei unpack a vase for presentation within the tokonoma. The piece had a real ora to it, I asked how old it was and was shocked to learn that it was over six hundred years old! Hard to grasp, especially as an American just how ancient that piece is.

Maurice C. Teague told officers he has more than 500 pairs of children's socks.   Investigating officers said they couldn't confirm the number but said they found 'a lot' of socks at Teague's home, police spokeswoman Sherry Mercurio said on Tuesday.   Police said Teague, 28, accosted the boy last Friday evening and dropped a piece of identification as he fled. They arrested him at his home on Sunday, Mercurio said. He's jailed on $75,000 bond.   'It's odd, obviously -- someone going after little boys' socks,' Detective Guy Patete said.   Police said the child was on his way home from the grocery around 6:30 p.m. when Teague asked to buy his socks for $5. The boy refused again when Teague offered him $10, and Teague picked him up, ran behind the store and pulled the boy's shoes and socks off his feet.   Police said the boy picked up Teague's identification and his mother called police.

For the first time in my sheltered little life I went out on a Monday night.  And I mean, OUT.  I didn't get home until 12:30.  Ten of us from work went to Lawrence for dinner and fun.  We ate at Free State, got crazy t-shirts at American Eagle (a slightly complicated story, but well worth it) and had the Sand Bar to ourselves.  And we danced.  It was so great.

I've been hearing weird things coming from his cage, a kind of clanging sound, but I was always too lazy to get up and see what he was doing.  As we sat at the kitchen table last night and looked at a Hy-Vee circular, I heard the noise and looked over to Roo.  He was chewing on the bars of his cage.  Which totally makes sense, because mice like to chew.  But Roo never has before.  I gave him a toilet paper tube about a week or two after I got him and he was totally not interested.  So I cut up a Kleenex box last night and gave him part of it, and sure enough he was chewing away in seconds.  Then I picked him up and we were playing and he wrapped himself around my finger and did some sort of flip and that's when I saw his mouse-parts.  Itsy-bitsy mouse-parts.  It makes sense.  I figured he wasn't more than a month old when I got him and it's been two months since and a mouse is full-grown/adult at 12 weeks.  I'm hoping this means he will stop pooping every five seconds.

12032304,Male,36,Advertising,"             You know how you can get in a rut, doing the same things and going to the same places, and when you break out of it you're pleasantly surprised that there's a world of people out there beyond your scope of personal experience? That's what happened to me last night, when I discovered the delightful world of  urlLink lesbians .  Paul had invited me to join him last night for  urlLink A Taste for Every Palette , a food-sampling social event raising money for the women's services programs of the Howard Brown Health Center, which is best known for serving the health needs of Chicago-area gay men.  As with every expensive fund-raiser serving the Chicago gay 'community,' the see-and-be-seen homosexuals were out in legion force -- though not at the Stepford levels you usually encounter at the events serving specifically men's interests. The wonderful twist at this event, though, was the prevalence of gay women.  I just never see gay women in my usual social tracks that take me from home to work to Boystown to the Chicago lakefront trail, and it was so great to be in a room filled with gay women unafraid to hold hands and smooch and socialize and have a great time together just like us fags do.  And I feel the need to make a few comments about stereotypes here:  They exist for a reason.  Gay men -- at least the ones I encounter at bars and social events such as these -- tend to dress on the trendy side of normal, use copious amounts of hair product and go out of their way to show the world they've spent a lot of time at the gym.  (I realize this is an overgeneralization, but by and large it's a very observable truth.  And I am more than guilty of helping perpetuate this image.)  In contrast, the women at the event last night tended to have short, sensible hair and dress in pants and conspicuously unsexy tops.  And they were  far  more gregarious around strangers than the status-conscious gay-male stereotype allows.  Just an observation.  One more observation:  This lesbian gender-bending stuff was seriously jamming Paul's and my gaydar last night.  There were a couple times when we commented on a cute guy across the room, only to discover that he was really a boyish woman with a sexy haircut.  ACK!  The event itself was a lot of fun.  There was an amazing variety of foods, and I think I sampled every dessert available.  (Of note were a chocolate cr�me br�l�e with fresh raspberries and a chocolate ganache cake with a raspberry pur�e.  And I'm not even a big fan of chocolate and raspberries together. But I  am  a fan of including diacritical marks in the names of foreign dessert foods. Such fun!)  It was held at the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum, which I've always wanted to check out.  The exhibits that were open to us party-goers weren't all that amazing, though.  There was a large butterfly sanctuary that was kind of cool, but everything else seemed to be artificial representations of things -- an odd curatorial choice for a place that bills itself as a 'nature museum.'    While I was there, I even got my picture taken by a Joe Photo guy from  urlLink boystownchicago ! The Joe Photo guys  never  take my picture at the events I go to, and my photo op makes me suddenly feel so relevant in the gay Chicago social scene.  After the event died down, Paul and I headed over to Sidetrack for some lesbian-free show-tune fun.  The place wasn't as crowded as usual, but we put in a good couple of hours of musical theater therapy and then headed home to sleep with our heads full of kicklines and our bellies full of chocolate.

12032306,Female,24,Advertising,"                  I have plenty of important things to talk about today. But instead, I'm going to rant. I just wasted 102 minutes watching  Lost In Translation . Yes, yes, I know the movie is like, 5 years old by now. I just haven't gotten around to watching it until tonight. Got it on On Demand.      I Think I'm The Only Person Who Did Not Like This Movie.  We all remember the comical trailers. We heard the hype and we watched it bring home the awards. So I was expecting a genius and funny, perhaps heartwarming movie with an albeit artistic slant from Ms. Coppola.   I should have known what I was getting into.   I remembered how much I disliked  The Virgin Suicides . But, given that TVS was Ms. Coppola's first effort, I applauded her. LIT was only marginally better, and its all b/c of Bill Murray. Truthfully, I don't know why this film was nominated for so many awards, nor, how it won any.  I will support my arguement here:  1. In both TVS and LIT, it seems as if too much weight is placed on the film being brilliantly shot, and not enough emphasis placed on the story. The cinematography was beautiful, but shouldn't have to carry the whole film. The editing was razor sharp. But, the direction was comparable to that of a student film. Certain parts of the film felt  like it was trying to be weird, just for the sake of being weird.      1A. To go back to the editing - at times I was confused. Throughout the early part of the film especially, Charlotte is shown in near back to back shots wearing different pjs. Either the clips got all mixed up in the computer, or Coppola is trying to suggest that multiple days were passing and the only occurance of note was Charlotte changing her clothes, Or Charlotte really did enjoy changing her tops several times a day.   2. 'Trying' is the defining word of this movie.  It tries to be mysterious and shy and coy . But the action is painfully slow and the characters  aren't developed enough to make the story intriguing.   3.  Not only are the characters not given a chance to develop, in some cases the performance feels completely wrong . Charlotte for example is a Yale grad who has been married for 2 years, and is accused of being 'snotty' and 'mean' by her husband. I believe that the character was meant to be very complex - part vamp, part 'lost' child with a bit of cynicism. She is portrayed by Scarlett Johansson who at 19 does the job of playing the innocent, and Could play up the sultry factor, but doesn't quite make it. Also,  the performance does not support Charlotte being a Yale grad that studied Psychology.  She spends more time giggling and looking partially glazed over. The conflict between her studies and her life only barely peeks through. Furthermore, she never seems to make any profund observations or statements that one would expect from a Philosophy major. Nor snide remarks that would qualify her snob title.  4. Overall, I think the other younger characters where erroneously cast. To me, the actors look like they would have been better off in American Pie Part 4.  Too young and not believable as up and coming high profilers.   5. Bill Murray makes the movie, and could have made it better if he did more 'Bill Murray'. Occasionally, he was  his witty, endearing and funny self, interspersed with expertly played indifference.  But there was so much more room for him.   6. I read that the script was very sparse and the film was largly  improvised .  Really?!? I couldn't tell...  7. This film wins the top prize in the ' Worst Foleyed ' and ' Worst ADR ' categories. My goodness. even on a small tv screen there is SO MUCH that doesn't line up. I can't imagine how hideous it looked on the large screen. Two specific places of horror are in the arcade when a kid is playing a video game by drumming..the ratio of sticks to 'pow' is pathetic. And, when Bob and Charlotte are lying on his bed talking, the room tone suddenly disappears, and of course the dialogue doesn't match up.   8. Can we say 'Anti-Climactic?'  A 5th grader could have guessed the plot twists , if you could call them that. As for the 'big climax' - we are thrown a couple of weak-ass curve balls that sort of miss the catcher and instead haphazardly bounce out of bounds. At the one shining moment where we could have seen  the brilliant manifestation of this transcendental nether-love , we get the hug. But for the kiss - the camera is awkwardly tight on, and off to the back/side of Bob's ear/cheek. Did Coppola not want us to see the kiss? If so, there would have been better angles with a more demure perspective. But she knew the kiss is what we wanted, so it seems that her answer was to compromise.  9.  Oooh but what did Bob whisper in Charlotte's ear??  The lingering question could have produced an answer as earth shattering as 'Rosebud' or Larua Palmer's admission that her father killed her. But no, the whisper is inaudible and the closed captionining confirms that fact. Admittedly, we WANT to know what Bob is saying. I've suggested to Dave the we extract the audio and attempt to isolate the dialogue by filtering out the background noises. But Dave doesn't think it will work. A quick internet search produces guesses from other viewers...  But in my opinion...I think Bill Murray improvised, and the crew lost the production audio. So he made something up for the ADR track. OR, perhaps in his improvisation he never said anything at all. And in either case - Coppola thought to herself  'Hey! This can be kind of cool, and Weird...I like it!'    This is why I spend $3.95 for On Demand instead of $10 at the movie theater.   Do you have a movie that you'd like to see me tear to shreds? Post a comment or send me an email.

12032309,Female,23,Advertising,"                 It's funny how sometimes you predict things without realizing it.  You seem to inherently know what will happen in the future even if you deny it or make yourself believe something else.  I have found this to be true in three different people this past week.  I feel as if sometimes people don't listen to themselves enough, cuz if they did they would hear the outcomes of their lives SCREAMING at them in multiple ways.  Lately I've been having all these thoughts and all these feelings that I almost feel I shouldn't be having, that I shouldn't be feeling - that it's almost WRONG to do so.  Today I realized that it's not wrong.  It's merely me trying to figure out what's going on, trying to figure out myself.  I have so much growing up to do its insane.  And while my mother keeps telling me that I'm 'on my own' and she's so proud of me, I feel ridiculous: living 'on my own' is just like living in college, only now I pay  all  of my own bills and pay her money as well.  I have been listening to a friend talk about how he wants to move away from the midwest, that he needs to 'get out of here' - I understand that feeling all too well.  I feel like I merely pushed the adventurous part of me to the back and left it there.  It's starting to stir.  And it's scaring me.  Sometimes you can look back over the past year and feel like you've grown so much.  And other times I look back and feel as if I'm still trapped.  Still peddling uphill without knowing where the fuck I'm going.  I want change.  And I almost feel as if it doesn't happen to me on it's own, I will burn bridges, breakup with friends, say goodbye to someone I love, goodbye to everyone I love, and make it happen my-goddang-self.

12032310,Male,24,Advertising,"    urlLink The New York Times > Opinion > Op-Ed Columnist: Maids vs. Occupiers   Maids vs. Occupiers By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN  Published: June 17, 2004 BEIJING  Visiting India and now China in the past few months tells me how much we Americans need to finish our business in Iraq and lower our profile there — not so we can wash our hands of the idea, and necessity, of promoting reform in the Arab world, but so we can advance that effort.  We can't dictate reform to the Arabs. Look at how even a watered-down reform proposal from the G-8 summit meeting — the Broader Middle East Initiative — was received in the Arab-Muslim world. No one paid any attention to it. The whole concept was dead on arrival because it was made in America, which is now radioactive in the Arab world.  The pressure for change has to come from within, and I think it can — if we lower our profile. Then the Arab world will have to look clearly at the fact that China, India, Sri Lanka and the Philippines — all the countries that provide maid service for the Saudi and other Arab ruling elites and manual labor for their construction — have leapt so far ahead with their own development that they are now taking good jobs away from America.   To put it another way, there are two ways for the U.S. to promote reform in the Arab world — where there is an ocean of untapped brainpower, particularly among women. One way is to try to dictate it, which is not working. American policy has become so unpopular in the Arab world that anti-reformers can easily delegitimize the reform process by labeling it a 'U.S. plot to destroy Islam,' and reformers are silenced because they don't want to be seen as promoting a made-in-America agenda.   The other way for us to promote reform is to get out of the way so people in the Middle East can see clearly that many of their maids' children — from India, China, Sri Lanka and the Philippines — are excelling at math, science and engineering, leaving Arab children, not to mention many American children, in the dust. (Over one million Indians work in Saudi Arabia alone.)  Only when the Arabs focus on how their maids' children are doing in the world, not what the Americans are doing in their region, will they revisit one of the most famous sayings of the Prophet Muhammad: 'Seek knowledge, even unto China. That is the duty for every Muslim.'  I hadn't been to China since 2001, and one of the first new things I noticed here was the number of women selling phone cards for cellphone minutes. While Islamist terrorists in Iraq and Saudi Arabia are using cellphone technology and cars to create bombs, China and India are making themselves the world's new-car manufacturing centers and are inventing new profit-making uses for Internet-enabled cellphones — none of which involve blowing anything or anyone up.   An Arab journalist friend living in London told me that there is today — sadly — an all too pervasive sense in too many quarters of the Arab world of a once-great civilization having been left behind, not unlike Weimar Germany. Because Germany was already a modern state, it created a massive military response to its humiliation: the Third Reich. 'The Arabs can't,' he said. 'So they create bin Ladenism instead, which can't build a state, only demolish one.'  So how does one get a healthy reform debate started? 'You need a courageous intelligentsia,' he said. 'You can't have that as long as people feel besieged. The new historians in Israel only emerged during Oslo. When you feel besieged, you will never start a debate with your brother and sister. Now it is the battle against the enemy, be it real or imaginary.'  All the more reason why we — the perceived enemy — need to hand over power to an elected Iraqi government, and move our troops into the background. If we can do that, I would suggest that next year the G-8 invite both India and China to join, and hold the next G-10 summit either at one of the manicured campuses of Indian outsourcing companies or in Shanghai's manufacturing hub. Then invite Arab leaders to attend. India and China were once seen as their equals.  Real change happens when people see something in those they compare themselves to, and draw their own conclusions — not when it's imposed on them. Our job was to smash Iraq's old order and lay the foundations for a new one. Now we need to lower our profile so people in that Arab-Muslim world can see clearly something we've been obstructing and they've been deliberately ignoring: that the world today wants to invest more in their maids' children than in their own children. Once that reality sinks in, so, too, will reform.     ",2004-06-17
12032311,Female,24,Agriculture,"             Over the weekend, my sister and I came up with, I think, an ingenious theory.  Now, probably many of you have heard the oft-repeated theory about The Smurfs Are Communist.  Well, this sort of resides along those lines, but we go after a different childhood cartoon, and in a slightly different fashion.  Ready for it?  Would you like to hear our hypothesis; let our facts, thoughts, and conclusions shatter yet another seemingly innocent children's tale?  Of course you are.  And here it is. . .brace yourself. . .  The Whos down in Whoville, the tall and the small, were  stoned . . . which is why they didn't care they had no presents at all.   And how could they have been stoned?  Where's the proof, you ask.  Well, the proof is shown by a simple fact, stated clearly in both the book and cartoon movie (which is practically word for word, and it would have to be; Dr. Seuss doesn't work in prose).  The simple fact is, kids, is the Whos were in possession of  Who Hash .  We all know the line '. . .he even took the last can of Who Hash,' as The Grinch looks at the camera with a knowing smile and wiggles his eyebrows.  Yep, he knows what he's doing later:  bakin' special brownies.   To add to this amazing revelation, we even have concluded that there is evidence of the Whos being stoned that very night The Grinch came to steal Christmas.  Evidence #1:  None of the Whos (sans one, which I'll discuss in a minute), woke up while the Grinch was trashing their places, stealing all their goodies.  Surely there was one light sleeper in the bunch, some adult Who person who had had too much Who Egg Nog and really had to use the facilities, but no.  Not a one was awake, and why?  They were stoned off of Who Hash, and they all had collapsed into slumber a few hours before the Grinch made his little stop.  Now there was that one exception, little Cindy Lou Who (no more than two), who needed some water.  Now, with Cindy being no more than two, and even stoned Who parents have some sense, she didn't get to have as much Hash as everyone else, but she did get a little.  Just enough to make her thirsty, and to be totally nonplussed when she finds some weird green Santa Claus (wearing no pants, mind you), in their Who living room that doesn't have a stick of furniture, stuffing their tree up the chimney, and obviously having a hard time of it.  She was just stoned enough to buy the green man's lame excuse of fixing a light bulb.  Yep, hash'll do that to you.  Now, Evidence #2:  they wake up, no presents, no  furniture  even, and what do they do?  They go out into the Common Green, hold hands, and start singing!  'Fa-who-la is Fa-do-la sing welcome Christmas Christmas time!'  The story goes that they're still happy and singing because Christmas came, just the same, without any presents at all.  Uh huh, sure thing, man.  If you woke up and found everything in your house to be MIA, wouldn't you flip?  I know the advertised point of the story is that material possessions don't matter, but most of us would be upset on some level.  It's sad but true; I bow down to the person who can truly say they would not be miffed.  But every Who in Whoville (the tall and the small), don't even care?  It's a cover-up for the fact that they were all stoned out of their minds, so of course they wouldn't care; they probably didn't even notice.  They just knew that they were feeling good, their houses seemed nice and spacious, hey y'all let's sing.  And what singing, too.  Fa-who-what?  Of course, if the Grinch hadn't been fooled into feeling remorse for his actions and therefore had not brought back the goodies, those Whos would have been right mad once they realized that the last can of Who Hash had been lifted from their little druggie town.  Green heads would have rolled all the way down Mount Crumpet.  And for the final evidence, I give you Evidence #3:  they all had the major munchies.  At the end of the cartoon movie, where the Grinch is carving the Roast Beast, everyone's happy and gnoshing away.  As the (cartoon) camera pans back, we see all the Whos going at their food like ravenous wolfhounds.  Look at that Who with the corn-on-the-cob!  You couldn't tear him away from that thing.  And that Who eating what looks to be mashed potatoes.  That one never comes up for air.  I guess after all the Who Hash, any normal Who would have the munchies.  Even the Grinch, the Grinch himself (who carved the Roast Beast, don't forget), probably had sampled some of the Who Hash as well; he goes at his roast with gusto.  In fact, every Who man, woman, and child are munching away, the druggies.  So there you go; the truth behind How The Grinch Stole Christmas, as discussed by my sister and I.  After thinking about all this, and having the realizations, it will make Thanksgiving Day a much more interesting event when they show the cartoon movie continuously for twenty-four hours, as is their custom.  Maybe I will even find more evidence, either for or against our argument.  I'll have to remember to write it down, or at least mentally file it away, and I'll post it here first.  Unless I'm stoned.  Then I just won't care.  (two notes:  I hate using the phrase 'cartoon movie,' but ever since Ron Howard tackled the Dr. Seuss classic, I have to make the distinction.  The cartoon movie is much, much more than a mere cartoon.  Second note, I hope y'all don't think I'm a stoner.  All of my knowledge on marijuana comes from popular culture, one testimonial from a weird acquaintance, and a story about a dumb cop from a fellow horticultural student.  This, of course, makes me an expert.)         ",2003-10-13

It upset us all, and we both replied to her posts with my reply at 1:30 this morning.  An hour later I was censored by her removal of my post.  Oh my, but she has awoken the beast.  What follows is my original reply that was written between midnight and 1:30 this morning, the 12th of July.  It has not been edited since then.  I am not posting this to try to appeal to Katie (PK), it is an effort on my part to clear my sister and her husband's name of any supposed wrongdoing.    _______________________________  To clarify, this is Carrie Paulk Williams, sister of Cathy.  To start, I understand the First Amendment; you have a right to say what you want to say to whomever you want to say it.  I am not mad at you because you ranted.  What I am, however, is absolutely disgusted, saddened, and infuriated at your reasoning behind these posts.  So I shall use my First Amendment right to counterpoint you.  First, to clarify parts where I am mentioned.  You state in your reply to Cathy's post that you 'didn't expect to be invited to Carrie's [wedding].'  And yet, in the second sentence of your first post, you complain that being left out of a wedding invite is the 'second time this happened in the same freaking family,' referring to my wedding of six months past.  If you didn't expect to be invited to mine, why are you upset that this is the 'second time' this has happened?  How contradictory.  Any information you received about our wedding was most likely given in response to your questions.  I cannot vouch for Sharon, Willis, and the others, but I know all the information you received from Steven was in response to your repeated questions.  He disliked giving you the details, but he felt it rude to say, 'We're not telling you that.'  Neither of us ever came up to you to tell you all about the wedding plans.    That takes care of the direct references to me.  Now on to your attack on my sister.  Indeed, it was an attack.  You meant for it to be heard.  If you did not, you would not have a link to your weblog from your buddy profile.  Cathy is not nor has ever been a spiteful, mean person, yet you talk as if she did not send you an invitation as a personal affront to you.  How dare you suggest such a thing of my sister.  You speak as if you were the best of friends and she stabbed you in the back.  Oh, I know you state later that you were never 'super close friends with' Cathy and Jason, but you sure give a different impression in your first post.  You list these ridiculous vague ties with Cathy and Jason, such as 'former roommate's [Jason's] girlfriend (now ex),' you 'were there the night they got engaged,' and the groom wanted to sign your cast, among others.  Whether you thought you were 'super close friends' or not, it reads as if you felt like you were a shoe-in for an invitation.  Now, to counterpoint your vague references mentioned above.  '[F]ormer roommate's girlfriend (now ex)' -- Yes, Jason and Paul were once roommates.  Yes, you and Paul used to date.  Later, you two broke up.   If I remember correctly, this was about three years ago.  You moved on.  Later you make a reference to Sharon's ex-boyfriend being invited, so therefore you should have been, too.  Cathy is friends with that boy; it had nothing to do with him once dating Sharon.    You were 'there the night they got engaged.'  Um, that reads to me like you were actually there the moment when Jason proposed.  That is certainly not true: they were by themselves on campus. Immediately afterwards they came to me and Steven to tell us the news, where they also called their respective parents.  Then they went to tell their best friend, Sharon.  You just happened to be visiting Sharon when Cathy and Jason showed up.  They had no intention of hunting you out to give you the news.  Now about the Jason wanted to sign your cast comment -- he wanted to sign it because he had never signed a cast before.  That had nothing to do with you specifically, it is just one of those simple pleasures in life that Jason has not yet gotten to experience.  It's a petty little thing, but you made it even pettier by presenting it as an argument for a wedding invitation.  It is a similar situation with the argument of Jason sending you links to their registry and wedding website.  He was so excited about the entire thing, he wanted to share his joy with everybody.  It did not insinuate that he wanted you to buy them something or wanted you to come.  I believe you read too much into these little actions.   ________________________  You state in your second post that you found Cathy's apology 'more upsetting' than if she had just lied to you and said, ' '[O]ops, we forgot.' '  Terribly sorry, but it is not Cathy, Jason's, or anyone else's job to placate you so you can feel better about yourself.  That is your own job.  I am flabberghasted that you would suggest it is others' responsibility to make you feel good.  That whole idea goes too deep for this conversation.  It is a problem.  You also state in your second post that what you find 'paticularly stinging is the fact that some of the people that were invited they [Cathy and Jason] rarely talk to and yet the groom talked to [you] a good number of times and they are deemed 'important enough' and [you were] not.'  Who exactly are you referring to?  I have already gone over Sharon's ex-boyfriend's friendship with Cathy and Jason; the only other person I can think of is Paul. If you think that Jason and Paul have not talked in three years, you are mistaken.  They talk reguarly; they have stayed friends.  Cathy has also known Paul since high school.  If you are referring to any other people than these two, please put them forth.     _____________________________  You used your weblog to vent your grievances; that is what they can be used for, among other things.  I do not have a problem with this fact.  You spoke your mind so that others, including Cathy and Jason, could know.  This weekend, they read your post, and they knew.  They were understandably upset, but they did not reply right away.  In fact, they waited a few hours to cool down before they replied.  They chose to give an apology.  It may not have explained themselves fully or gone over your issues point by point, but they apologized, out in the open for everyone to see.    What did you do with it?  You threw it back in their face as soon as you read it.  You did this out in the open as well, for everyone to see.  You gave yourself no chance to collect your thoughts; it was posted in the height of very misplaced hurt and anger.  What do you want from them?  What can they say to make you happy?  I do know one thing:  they will not say they made a mistake in not inviting you.  This whole debacle of the weblog justifies their decision, in my opinion.  You state that Cathy and Jason's apology can be summed up as 'you're not important' to them.  I'm afraid you've hit the nail on the head:  you're not important.  That is the facts and you need to accept it.  You cannot be best friends with everybody.  You can, however, be annoying to everybody.  Amazing how that works.  ____________________________  As I said before, you have your First Amendment rights.  But you must use those rights with a degree of respect.  By these posts that you have sent online, you have disrespected my sister, her husband, their friends, and their family, including Steven and me.  Cathy and Jason were under ABSOLUTELY NO OBLIGATION to invite you to anything.  Even if they had so much as told you to your face that you were going to be sent an invitation, they would not have been obligated to send you one.  No matter what signals from Cathy and Jason that you express you received, you were not guaranteed anything.    The fact that you expected anything from Cathy and Jason is revolting.  Yes, the First Baptist Church of Auburn is 'big enough' and one more person would not have 'cramped [their] style.'  However, your specific presence would have 'cramped their style,' as you put it.  To put it extremely bluntly, you were not wanted, just as you were not wanted at my wedding.  For you to expect to be wanted is sadly optimistic.  You should not lash out at others because you think they cause you unhappiness.  Truly happy people do not let the actions of others cause such grief and distress as you express has happened to you due to the lack of a wedding invitation.  All you end up doing is hurting yourself and others.  I am one of those 'others,' notice it is one o'clock in the morning while I am sending this message to you.    If you have anything more to say, you do it through private e-mail or by phone.  My e-mail address is hissineedyou@gmail.com and my phone  number is 256-996-9890.  Do not mess with the Paulk girls.         ",2004-07-09

12032319,Female,24,Agriculture,"             Here's an interesting side note from the whole 'RIAA Sues The World' saga (surely you heard they sued a 12 year old girl):   'Meanwhile, several internet music services have offered to pay the $2,000 (£1,255) fine paid by the mother of 12-year-old Brianna LaHara to settle the lawsuit the RIAA had filed against the girl.    Grokster president Wayne Rosso, a member of the peer-to-peer services trade group P2P United, said he felt the RIAA were acting like 'bullies' by targeting a young girl, which is why it was offering to pay the money. ' (source:  BBC)   This whole mess does make for interesting reading in the news.  Every day there's some new blurb someone said that either justifies or condemns the sharing of files, or a new lawsuit served out, protested, or settled.  And then there's that whole amnesty thing. . . please.    It seems to me that the RIAA might be hurting itself more than the people they're out to get, though.  They're suing these people in hope that they will become their customers again.  And man, the analogies are abound on this subject like RIAA subpoenas in courts.  The more I read them the more I figure you can make any analogy to suit your purpose.  RIAA says 'you wouldn't steal a BMW because you thought the price was too high,' and the file sharers spit back 'yeah but you get to test-drive a BMW, and there are cheaper cars on the market.'  Both sides make it a question of ethics, right and wrong, wwjd? and that sort of thing.  Well, wtfwjd?    I think the bare truth of it is it's just incredibly  easy  to get a music file for free off the internet.  Why get dressed and go out to hunt up some obscure CD when you can do a quick search for the file in your jammies?  Easy easy easy.  And cheap, which is always good for the college students.  More money for beer.  Simple as that man, not a matter of ethics, matter of convenience.  Just recently have there been some legitimate music services out there where you can listen to all the music you want.  You do pay money, yes, but it's cheaper than going the CD route.  For Mac users, there's Apple's I Tunes.  Well, that covers about 8% of the computer population.  Well done.  Right now I'm using a service called  urlLink Rhapsody .  Nine bucks a month or 25 bucks for three, listen to whatever you want (that they have, and might I add that their selection of film scores is lacking), and you can download for under a buck a song.  Best that I know of for Windows people right now.  However, the free stuff is still out there.  Why pay nine bucks a month when you can get it for free?  Where does it all end?  (Stop the internet please, I'd like to get off. . .)   The internet has instituted a whole new way of doing things, and there is no precedent.  It's changing the way we exchange information (for the better, I think), and we will have to change some ourselves to keep up.  Copyright laws included in that statement.  Now it's not only information we're exchanging now, its things like movies, music, computer programs, and pictures.  In other words, intellectual property, which can be very vague in definition anyway.  How in the world can you control use of this intellectual property when it's so easy to copy and distribute among the masses?  There is no clear answer as of yet, but one surefire way of not doing things is to go around like Big Brother, watching every move you do, waiting for you to do something 'against the rules.'  Read 1984.  It's just not right.   Not only can you partake of other people's intellectual property, now you can just as easily create your own.  With the internet, anybody, and boy do I mean anybody, can write songs, create art, write fiction, nonfiction, poetry, journals, whatever man, and publish it in the internet.  It's cheap, instantaneous, and anybody can do it.  It rules out the middle man entirely.  No publishers, managers, distributors, or (unfortunately) proofreaders.  The creator of all this stuff becomes all of these things, and therefore, they get more control.  Granted, there is a lot of absolute shit on the internet, and something like over half of it is porn, but those few shining stars do make their way out of the sludge.  Weird crazy stuff that you'd  never  see in mainstream.  There's the hilarious  urlLink All Your Base Are Belong To Us video thing , and  urlLink explodingdog.com , to name a few popular things in the internet culture.  I doubt this stuff could have come to the forefront of our culture through the snail-media (smedia, hahaha).   What it comes down to, is no middle man equals no RIAA and similar organizations, and I believe they know it.  I think this lawsuit crackdown is done out of desperation and fear, and possibly a little loathing.  A how-come-they-didnt-see-this-coming sort of thing.  I don't think anybody did.  The internet was originally just a group of researcher's computers, networked so they could more easily exchange stale, academia-style information.  And now, just look what has happened.  In just a short amount of time, too.  I don't believe it's the end of the world as we know it, like the RIAA would have us to believe.  They thought similar things with the advent of recordable cassette tapes.  This little snag will work itself out in the next three years, and some new revolutionary event will explode again.  Who knows what would happen next?  I can't even begin to imagine.         ",2003-09-12

12032324,Female,23,Biotech,"                 Aye, aye, aye.  Just the title leads you to think there was probably a little drinking going on perhaps even some intoxication.  If you DO think that, you are absolutely right.  My friend KP and I had these plans of meeting my parents at their house on Friday staying there then going to Harrisburg for the Troegs Brew Fest.  It really was a great juicy weekend. So... here it goes.    MK hooked up with my sis.  Literally.  Don't know what happened completely But I know he was in her room for a good chunk of the night.  How do I know this?  I was in the basement asleep on the futon with CJ.  Now, now, who is this CJ?  If you are thinking that it's a different one of my brother's friends you are correct.  I had only met CJ once before and on this second meeting we didn't talk very much at all as we were drinking and playing asshole.  But, he has a cocky sort of attitude which I liked about him.  We all (CJ, MK, KP, TS (my brothers fiancee), my brother, my sister and I) went night swimming after a few games of asshole and almost a case or two of beers.  After swimming my sister and MK stayed outside... For a WHILE.  Inside I pull out the futon and go upstairs to get sheets and blankets to make CJ's bed up. He tells me to go put on dry clothes then I can come back down and work out his kinks.  Like he is going to ALLOW me to do that.  I acted all offended but went and put on my sleeping attire.  After the massage we were talking about religion and I guess he's pretty serious about being catholic.  A whole conversation ensues which ends with a kiss.  And then kissing.  And then sleeping.  I wake up and it's 6:00.  Whoa! The fam's going to be up soon.  So I go up to my bed where KP and I were supposed to be sleeping the whole time.  When I get up I see MK sleeping on the floor.  (Wonder when he came down, haha, oh well).  I told him to climb in bed with CJ and I'm off .  I sleep in my own bed for about an hour.  When the folks wake up and my bro come down stairs the ponder where MK is asleep.  (I pretend not to know, of course)    I honestly think it's better this way b/c I wasn't feelin' him so much.  My sister knew that.  I told her the weekend before.  That is he wasn't as cute as he is that I prolly wouldn't talk to him.  Superficial, I know.  But there was one thing that I did like about him.  How open he was about sex.  I mean, I've never been with a guy who would just talk about it like that and it was really refreshing.  (especially since I think NG is a little on the shy side when it comes to sex)  He sometimes talks about wanting to jump on me.  And I say I wouldn't mind, then, he gets up.  But I digress.  Beer festival time.  I'm a little unsure about what's going to happen.  I mean how is MK going to act? How is CJ going to act?  How am I supposed to act????  The day time was fine the guys were playing golf the whole AM so I didn't have to deal with that.  By the time they got back it was about time to head to Harrisburg. (there is a little phone call missing in here but that's a whole different story).  I seriously had such a great time at the beer fest.  MK was super cool I got to hang out with CJ more TS and KP and Mom and I were chilling.  Everyone was drunk.  I remember CJ and I walking around and my Dad was like, 'huh?  You guys?  What?'  He pretended that he was mad.  Somehow CJ and I got separated from the rest of the crew.  That was around 8:30 when they stopped serving.  And We ended up back at the hotel by ourselves.  Went to the room we were making out.  And almost came to sex. It didn't though and I'm so glad!  CJ was like are you sure you want to do this...And I said no I'm not sure.  And we stopped making out talked more kissed more.  The rest of the guys came back then MK decided he wanted to leave (don't know why) I tried to talk him in to staying.  And he said 'stop talking to me. Why don't you go fuck [CJ] again.'  Angry much?  Sorry, buddy, you fucked up first.   Um so then CJ talked him into staying.  Which is good.  All was well in Harrisburg.    All is well in Pittsburgh too.  NG came over last night.  He looked amazing when I saw him.  I really missed him.  But in the back of my mind I'm thinking about CJ too.  I don't want to mess things up with NG because of CJ.  But I also don't want to miss out on getting to know CJ better because I'm seeing NG.  What to do....                ",2004-06-18
12032325,Female,33,Biotech,"       News on Mark.  Doc says he has a couple of compressed discs.  Now he gets to take prednizone  .  I am a little nervous about him taking that medication.  My Mom had to take it when I was a kid and the side affects were severe psychosis and depression.  Essentially I spent all my time trying to be the little mommy and cook dinners for us and dad and keep my little brother out of firing range.  She went nuts, literally.  It had to be awful for her. Being a kid that was not what I was thinking about at the time though.  I was learning how to cook... FAST.  Good thing it was during the summer or I would have never been able to get my brother and I off to school and fed and everything else.  Anyway, looks like Mark will slowly get better and I will be watching closely for psychosis.         ",2002-12-11
12032326,Male,25,Biotech,"       A 20-ton chunk of granite from the Adirondack Mountains in upstate New York will be placed inside the 70-foot deep foundation, launching a five-year construction plan for a 1,776-foot skyscraper that will become an iconic symbol for the New York City skyline.'What better day to lay the cornerstone of the Freedom Tower than the day our country declared its independence,' said Gov. George Pataki, who has named the building the Freedom Tower.'Everyone understands that this is more than a building, more than just a site. It is a symbol of American freedom, and a symbol of our renewal,' Pataki said.About 100 family members of September 11 victims will be present for the cornerstone ceremony.'It's one more step to this hole not being here. It's one more step to recovery,' said Charles Wolf, the husband of a trade center attack victim. 'It's not just to show that we're rebuilding, it's important to rebuild.'Wolf's wife, Katherine, 40, began working for Marsh and McLennan, on the 97th floor of the north tower, just three weeks before it was struck by a 767 jetliner hijacked by al Qaeda terrorists.'They may have gotten my wife, but they're not getting the rest of my life, and I think we Americans are saying they're not getting our life either.'Some 9/11 families have criticized rebuilding officials for sidestepping historic preservation and the commitment not to rebuild on the acre-wide squares where the twin towers were anchored, known as their 'footprints.''We are not opposed to the rebuilding moving forward. We just don't want it to move forward and the physical remains of the footprints to be destroyed in that process,' said Anthony Gardner, whose brother Harvey was killed inside the south tower.Opinions vary widely on what standard defines the 'tallest building in the world,' whether it includes towers or antenna or neither in the measurement of height. Some buildings are tallest in one category and not under a different standard.The Freedom Tower's torqued glass and steel tower includes a 276-foot spire. A broadcast antenna will bring the total height above 2,000 feet.          ",2010-10-10

12032331,Male,36,RealEstate,"            HAPPY ANNIVERSARY TO JEFFFIFER   &nbsp;  Jeff and I have officially been together for seven years as of July 15th.&nbsp; When I look back, on some levels I think it's amazing that we have stayed together for so long.&nbsp; On other levels, it makes perfect sense.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  In the beginning, I kind of made a big deal about it and he looked at me as if I had suggested that we take Ground Hog Day off and throw a party.&nbsp; Eventually, I just settled for realizing it had come and passed a few weeks earlier.&nbsp; I would look up from the newspaper and say to him, 'By the way, happy belated anniversary.'&nbsp; Then I would go back to&nbsp;Marilyn Van Savant in  Parade Magazine .  &nbsp;  This year has probably been the most challenging.&nbsp; I've basically gone to work for myself and Jeff is trying to start his own business in his spare time.&nbsp; Also, we've basically gotten to the point where we no longer treat each other with kid gloves and just say it like it T-I-S.&nbsp; This doesn't always go over well.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Romance is still there, but we're not quite as lusty as we once were.&nbsp; Well, looking back, I may have only been the lusty one from the beginning.&nbsp; I've gotten to the point where I'm quite satisfied to kiss him goodnight and disappear into a good book.&nbsp; 'How will Harry escape from Snape this time?'  &nbsp;  A few days after Jeff came back from Central America, we sat upstairs and discussed our relationship and our differences.&nbsp; Neither one of us is sure that we completely understand where the other is coming from, but we have decided that we are both committed to one another to make it work.&nbsp; I just can't imagine being with anyone else.&nbsp; He can't either.&nbsp; Afterwards, we made out on the bed for an hour like a couple of horny teenager after a football game in the back of a Pinto.  &nbsp;  I made reservations at  urlLink Pricci's .&nbsp; My boss gave me a gift card to the  urlLink Buckhead&nbsp; Life Restaurant Group  for Christmas and I decided to take us out for a nice dinner to celebrate.&nbsp; When he came home, he brought me some roses.&nbsp; In fact, I'm looking at them now and they are orange, pink, yellow and white.&nbsp; They have opened up and are quite beautiful and fragrant.&nbsp; It really allowed me to get in touch with my inner teenage girl, albeit I didn't cry or anything.&nbsp; It just made me feel gooey inside.  &nbsp;  I actually put on&nbsp; a tie and we went to dinner.&nbsp; It was very nice.&nbsp; We had baked lobster crepes for an appetizer and followed it with a seafood salad for me and a salad that focused on tomatoes for him.&nbsp; For entrees, I had toretelli and he had something meaty that was once part of an animal.&nbsp; I can't remember now because we tossed so many things around.&nbsp; I want to say it was a lamb shank or something.&nbsp; Afterwards we had coffee and tiramisu.&nbsp; I will admit that you could definitely tell it was made from scratch, but I still favored Publix tiramisu over Pricci's dessert.&nbsp; I don't know why.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I was pretty stuffed from eating so much.&nbsp; I went to the restroom and they had the hallway lined with photographs of celebrities.&nbsp; There was a pic of Elton John and Rod Stewart with a couple of women.&nbsp; There was a picture of Steve Martin with Anne Heche before Ellen entered the picture.&nbsp; It was interesting.  &nbsp;  We laughed a lot and came home.&nbsp; I slipped into bed with a good book and he instantly fell asleep.&nbsp; I finished reading the  urlLink The Blue Meridian: The Search For The Great White Shark . It is the story of how some filmmakers went about shooting the documentary  urlLink Blue Water, White Death , which is the first time anyone captured the great white shark on movie film.&nbsp; Peter Benchley used it as the basis of his research as he was writing  Jaws .&nbsp; Jeff bought the book for me at a yard sale because he knows how much I love sharks.&nbsp; In fact, if I had to list any true heroes, I would have to name Ron and Valerie Harper, two Australian naturalists (wildlife, not nudists) who have brought more attention to how amazing sharks are than anyone else on the planet.  &nbsp;  After I finished the book, it was late and I looked over at Jeff sprawled out on the side of the bed, hair askew and his mouth open.&nbsp; I thought he looked very beautiful.&nbsp; It was like the way that the author described the shark in the book.&nbsp; Yes, they sometimes attack people by mistake, but if you truly look at great white sharks for the perfect creations of nature they are, they seem so beautiful.&nbsp; Yes, sometimes Jeff and I don't agree on some things.&nbsp; However, I cannot ever imagine loving anyone more beautiful than him.

12032332,Female,25,RealEstate,"           i'm not feeling particularly witty or funny or anything, but if i don't make a post soon, nicole's threatened to disown me.  her kids are out of school for the summer, so she is crazier than normal crazy level due to the fact that she watches every single kid in round rock in her three thousand square foot home.  (special note here to round rock child protective services:  nicole doesn't really watch every kid in round rock, i'm exaggerating.  but she does not like her kids to be in the homes of their friends, she'd prefer the kid's friends be at her home.  she is the fun mom.  right now she is constructing a aquarium the size of her kitchen to house all the frogs and tadpoles they've been collecting at the river.  i think she should charge admission.)  yesterday, after a night of crown royal and porch sitting, i got up early and joined a group of friends to tube down the comal river.  we picked us some beer and headed to new braunsfels for some f-u-n fun.  i'm not a big fan of rapids and floating into debris, so the comal and i go together like peas and carrots.  the guadalupe was closed due to the high volume of rain, and i was secretly glad, cause the guadalupe is beginning to end rapids and debris.  i've never left there with less than twelve bruises.  yeah, so the comal.  after the last stretch of our second float down the comal, the rain began to fall.  not drizzle, not light rain, but pouring ass cold ass painful ass rain.  i actually kind of enjoyed the rain.  i think the beer consumed increased my tolerance to what would normally be a huge disappointment when it comes to something like say floating a river in a tube.  i have a date with a really cute boy tonight (a cousin to a friend of mine).  he's only seen me after 6 hours of tubing and thought 'for a girl that just got done tubing, you're pretty cute.'  i'm excited to get dressed up like a girly girl and hopefully surpass his expectations.  this boy is precious.  he is a total texas boy.  he frames houses and drives a pick up truck.  but also makes hemp necklaces and plays the trumpet.  i feel like a teenager...i haven't been this excited about a date with a boy in a long while.  and i promise not to call him 'the boy' 'a boy' or any variation of that tonight.

12032335,Male,36,RealEstate,"            KYLIE MINOGUE MAILING LIST   I realized today that even though I'm sure Abby is a fine girl, I do not need to receive 50 e-mails from her each day regarding Australian, pop singer, Kylie Minogue.  Abby, who I believe lives in Oklahoma, loves Kylie.  I know this because she mentions it in her many e-mails each day.  She also loves Kylie fans and carefully places little 'X's' and 'O's' in her e-mails to signify the love and kisses that she is spreading to us all.  I'm not sure how I suddenly got on the Kylie Minogue Mailing List, but I began receiving e-mails about two months ago.  I would like to know updates on when new material is being released, but I do not want to do speculate on whether or not Kylie has had a brow lift, if she and her boyfriend, Oliver Martinez, have secretly wed, wax on about the merits of Kylie painting her front door pink, debate whether or not you can actually see her left nipple in a photo from 1988 or what Kylie song is best to make love too.  For consistent rhythm and motion during the dirty deed,  The Loco-Motion  is going to win hands down every time. It's time to let go.  Now I must find where the details are to unsubscribe myself from the list.  Sorry, Kylie, but I must be free.         ",2004-06-27
12032336,Female,35,RealEstate,"       The Middle East is exploding in violence. The budget is not the only 'deficit' this Administration has created... but a 'moral' deficit as well, run by a thief to the Presidency that praises God while being the single greatest source of evil in the world, jeopardizing both our safety and financial future.   Who knew that 'Leave No Child Behind' was not their 'education' policy but in fact their 'military' policy?   Claiming to be a friend of the environment while gutting environmental laws, rolling back existing legislation on some of the most notorious corporate polluters in history.  Illegal price-fixing collusion with the Saudi's has produced the highest gasoline prices in history, along with promises to bring prices back down in time for the November elections.  They started an unnecessary war with one of the few secular nations left in the Middle-East; a country that had not attacked us, had been disarmed and was under control, resulting in the needless deaths of hundreds of American soldiers and more than 10,000 Iraqi civilians; turning what wasn’t a haven for terrorist into just that.  They turned a global outpouring of sympathy and compassion for the U.S. after 9/11 into a global loathing and even seething hatred of all things American.  The nightmare is spiraling out of control and no one in this Administraion can understand why. It's time to TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK and send this neo-fascist regime back to Crawford!

12032337,Male,36,RealEstate,"             It's such a beautiful day!!  And about damn time, too, considering it's May 11th!  Blogger has a new look and I think I like it.  Not so much happening in my world today.  Amanda came over last night and we started a lively game of Monopoly at about 9 pm that lasted for about 2 1/2 hours.  Amanda was kicking my ass & Chris's too!  She owned both utilities and all 4 railroads.  Chris was the first to erect a hotel and he would have bought more if it hadn't been so late.  I think I came out on the short end of the stick with fewer properties, but I did have Boardwalk and Park Avenue in my pocket!!  I've read so much these past few days about the Iraqi prison abuse and then I hopped over to  urlLink DaGoddess's  site.  I think she puts into words what I cannot, so please go and read.  It's a great post and if there's anything I could gank from her site today, it would be:  urlLink Apologies Do Not Weaken Us & Let's Move Forward .  And there's only one more thing I'd like to cover before I sign off today.  My friend (and co-worker) got a call from her oldest son, who is about 12 years old.  He was upset and crying.  She calmed him down and asked him what was wrong.  Turns out that some kids tried to jump him when he got off the bus at his block.  (The bus drops him off 1 block from his house)  This group of kids called out to him and he tried ignoring them.  Then one kid came at him and punched him in the neck.  Another kid was about to hit him when he took off running.  He ran home and called his mom.  She was upset - who wouldn't be - and left work early.  Her son did the right thing by getting out of the situation quick, but that leaves you to wonder what will happen tomorrow and the next day when he gets off the bus.  What about the day after that?  It's not like she can be there every day when the bus drops him off nor should she have to baby him.  After all, kids get into fights.  It's simply a part of growing up.  But when you and your kids live in Brooklyn, Queens, Harlem, the Bronx, New Jersey, etc, you realize that things aren't like they were when you were growing up in a small town in the middle of BFE where people would actually stop and help someone in need.  Here, in this metropolis we call New York, people aren't as nice.  When someone is in need of help, most people here just walk on by and pretend they didn't see or hear a thing.  No one wants to be held responsible or worse yet, liable for something that might go wrong.  That's one of the scariest things about what happened to my friend's kid today.  If this group of kids really had tried to hurt her son, would anyone have stopped to help?  I'd like to think so, but I somehow doubt it.         ",2004-05-11

12032341,Female,25,Manufacturing,"       Why me…Why me??!!…  I think the worst thing about a relationship is that not only you get engaged with your partner but also with the inlaws, and “Antisocial Yoli” don’t like to play social with the inlaws.  I’ve told my boyfriend trizzillion times I don’t like to spend more than 30 seconds with his family because of the difference in culture, language, and what not; I know it sounds ugly, bad and horrible but that’s how I am. Saturday we went to buy my boyfriend his new cell phone and he wanted me to help him out choose one. I don’t consider myself cheap, I just consider myself practical and economical and that’s the reason why all my clothes have no international brand names or well known designers like Gucci or Armani, Guess, etc, etc, etc. For me, as long as is a good quality clothe, comfortable, good looking and at a reasonable price is good enough for me. The same goes with everything else I use around me, so with that thought I was looking around for a cheap reliable phone for my boyfriend, well, as expected, we found a nice phone with all those cool gadgets you can find in a phone that even I was drawling for and my boyfriend wanted it. It was the most expensive phone on show, and well, to make the long story short, that’s the phone he got; he’s happy now with his new phone.   Everything was beautiful, like one of those romantic weekends you love to spend with your boyfriend until he mentioned the sentence “Let’s go see my sister” I felt every little hair in my body arose from my skin and felt the “goose bumps”. I wanted to scream, I wanted to run away and get the hell out, but I could not, we were in the freeway at more than 75 miles per hour and that would be completely suicidal for me. So the only thing I could do is put my miserable ugly face like “Do we have to?” and the story began all over again.  Bf: Why what’s wrong? Me: Nothing I just get so bored! Bf: But it will be just for a little bit, I promised my sister I would go over and see her Me: Well how bit will be that little bit? Bf: Just a few minutes, 15 minutes just to stop by and say hello. Me: …  Well actually it wasn’t only 15 minutes, it was 2 hours to be exact, good thing I am starting to understand a little bit of my boyfriend’s language so I could catch up a bit of the conversation he was having with their sisters, and it really wasn’t a good nice chat, it was more like an argument.   Sunday morning, my boyfriend told his sisters he would take them to Balboa Park, for those who know the area of San Diego, CA. and have seen Balboa Park is a very nice park where you can enjoy the culture and relax while watching the nice structures of the museums around, it’s big, with lots and lots of trees and well, if you really want to enjoy it you should walk around every little hidden corner of this Museum/Park; I was excited to go since the last time I was there was 10 years ago. Everything was just as I left it and just a few things got enhanced but the rest was all the same. At this point, hell was about to begin.  I’ve never went with the inlaws anywhere else but their homes or to the beach but never to any other place like a big park or a cultural center and believe me I will never go with them again. It was a nightmare, it was embarrassing and shameful. This place is one of the most beautiful places to go and walk and just breathe the fresh air with lots and flowers and natural living and well in my case I love to walk, and walk, and walk until I loose all sense in my feet and that’s what I wanted to do, but, you know in all the parks there are benches ever 3 feet so, there you saw the whole family (sisters and nephews) sitting almost everywhere; the funniest thing was that they just ate their lunch 1 hour before and when we got out of the car my boyfriend asked me if we could eat inside, I said yeah sure of course, but I never thought they would bring 3 buckets of water, 2 bags of cookies and bread and pistachios and sunflower seeds and god knows what else they were carrying in those bags, as if they were really going to sit down and eat. So we get out of the car and walk towards the park and guess what? There was a place with grass and shade and 2 or 3 people sitting so they went there and sat, I look at my boyfriend and say:  Me: What?! We have lots of things to see! Bf: Yeah I know but let’s just sit down and drink a little bit of water Me: What tha! Bf: Come sit with us and then we keep on walking Me: Alright, you sit here with your family I’ll go walk, I’ll catch you guys later!  That’s how it went the 4 hours we stayed in the park, they were sitting and I was walking, actually I walked the whole park around two times and they were still sitting, not on the same spot no, no, no, they were sitting every 3 feet where they saw benches. “Oh look, one bench and has shade, let’s sit down and eat”. Of course while they were walking the only thing I could hear were my boyfriend’s nephews just mocking at everything they saw, one girl playing the violing “mock, mock, mock” One big building with medieval pictures “mock, mock, mock”. It was very, very, very annoying, to the point I wanted to kick their …. Ok, I’ll calm down now.  And my boyfriend wants to take them all to the Zoo….Yeah right! I’m not spending my share of money waiting for these people to sit, and eat, then get up walk three feet and sit down again and eat while the whole zoo is waiting for me to enjoy. Hell no, that’s no fun at all! People you gotta exercise more! And let’s just say, I am the fatty in the family ok?  So there you have it folks, yes it was a shieety Sunday, which I must say I spent with myself, walking alone all over the precious place because my boyfriend could not let them sit by themselves, oh no, they might get lost…in the bench… Bull…  This morning I am not in a nice mood as you can tell, I have no server, so I can’t work, which means I am delayed now, which means I won’t go home early, which means I’ll be late for everything.

12032346,Male,23,Manufacturing,"       Mad Cows Disease strikes again.  What  bothers me most about Mad Cows disease is that it exists. This is a truly digusting and bizarre problem. To be knowingly feeding cows other cows thus resulting in a disease that's 'brain wasting' in humans-- why? Why do this? Why run such risks. There is the claim that most meat isn't using central nervous tissue. Yeah- but why eat from a cow that has a brain wastig disease in it's body? Who's in charge of saying it's a risk worth taking. Maybe all of us who are eating it.  But there is a degree of trust you give to the institutions that give you your food. Call me naive, but we place a degree of trust in the fact that food we buy at the market isn't gooing to turn around and waste our brains in 3-8 years.  ASk yourself why a government and an industry wouldd lie to it's people, and be careless in such a way that all of us are at risk instantly of brain wasting. Think about why.  THink about the movie Soylent Green. Then think about the movie Ikiru. They are both applicable to these times. In a way, the mad cow's procolomation was that opening shot of Ikiru for America- sure not everybody has seen it that way-- but it might not be a bad idea to take Kenji Watanabe's cue and see it that way.  Regardless, Ikiru is a great movie, and so is Soylent Green. Iff you don 't know why Soylent Green appplies, you should rent it and fidn out, and if you do know you should rent it anyways casue while you probably heard the last line of it a million times you still might want to spend the 90 minutes getting the whole story.

12032347,Female,23,Manufacturing,"           My First short story.  Writer’s Note: It’s not about the facts, it’s about issue.  This is an issue that has always been a problem for me.  I technically believe in freedom of choice but life is the most precious thing in my mind.  The conflict of feelings is always inside me.  I’m bringing it out for all of you.    A Great Hollow   It was the cold busy days right before the holidays and two police officers stood at the mouth of the north corridor standing vigil over the travelers, shoppers, and holiday tourists.  They were natives of Manhattan.  Both were used to the charge in crowds around the festive season.  From this position in the grand main hall of the terminal they had helped to stop purse thieves, shop lifters, and too often gave directions to a weary passer-byer.  It was a welcome beat out of the cold of winter.  Both stood relaxed as they gazed over the cavernous marble room filled with couples, families, and chatty groups.  Everyone was bustling about to their own rhythm in the grand hall, each oblivious most of the others.  It was like watching bugs in the summer.  Each had their own little route, plan, and goal to accomplish as they went in and out and back in again.  The two cops were quite adept to watching the human bugs buzz around.  They always took notice of anything unordinary among the disorganization.  It was a trait every officer had to develop.  At this time of the year they both noted the lack of single travelers other than the occasional businessman.  However, it just so happened that the two officers happened to see a young man walk into the grand hall, crossed his legs, and sit down on the polished marble floor with his back to a great pillar.  Both officers looked to one another as they took notice of this abnormality.  With the fall collegial year over this boy stood out.  The 20-some year old boy looked up at the train schedule and then over to the storefronts before settling his gaze on a book he had in his hands.  He was a rebellious looking young man; with his pants big, black, and baggy.  His hair was cut at uneven lengths and many of his visible body parts were pierced or encrusted with silver.  It wasn’t long before he took up a pen and began glancing about the large hall as he wrote through his dangling bangs of deep brown hair.  The officers stopped their regular hall gazing to take a good look at him.  Each considered himself a good judge of character but when they turned to each other the words did not come out the same. “Look at this one, probably didn’t finish his community service at the college.  He must have had to stay an extra two weeks because he was up late drinking one night and got caught.” The older one said as he crossed his arms across his broad chest.  He was Officer John McKarney, a loyal husband, and father of two boys.  He considered himself an expert on college age behavior since having his oldest son graduating soon and his younger just starting his freshmen year.  He was already forming the boy’s family life in his mind. “He probably got a full scholarship because of his writing but is blowing it all by spending too much time hanging with his ‘peeps’ in moody coffee cafes rather than studying.  He’s most likely going home to face a busy father and an overly social or drugged up mother.  For now the only thing he has to comfort him is that ratty journal.” He finished allowing his horse voice to really show through, as if he were leaning back in his chair watching a movie to which he already knew the end.  Officer Mike Lawrence took in the idea openly but had his own take on the young but individualized youth.  Being only in his early 30’s he took a look back at his younger self and then though on the boy. “He’s probably a good kid.  Maybe he was working at the café you mentioned and he couldn’t get out of work early enough.  If he has both his parents they are just open minded towards his approach to life.  You can’t be so negative on the boy, John.” He said sympathetically.  The older cop made a noise somewhere between a grunt and a sigh.  As much as they were able to get along during the long hours on the beat, both officers didn’t like to back down about their opinions on a person.  Usually, a disagreement meant a change in subject.  Both tried to look beyond the boy and get back to their surveillance of the main hall.  But both noticed as the boy checked out the train schedules again, then picked up his pack, and headed right past between them for his train.  Both the policemen noted that he didn’t have much of an expression on his face.  He wasn’t worried or happy or sad.  Each made some more mental notes on his heavy pack and ragged notebook before turning back to the main room.  ******  Earlier that evening the library closed and Ms. Loraine stretched and sighed as she got up from her chair at the information desk.  It was another quiet day only filled with infectious whispering.  When the last person left the library she turned on her small radio and began gathering up the books left out or misplaced.    She had always wondered about the people who left the books out on the table.  She usually found a variety of subjects all out next to one chair.  She imagined there must be some real bookworms in New York.  Either that or someone’s Internet connection was down.  She giggled to herself slightly as she picked up oddly stacked self-help books and a dieting book that was along side a book on chocolate.  There were children’s books mixed with romance novels… obviously a mother and child.  There were the occasional how-to books where she would also find pens and the rare greasy handprint.  This one kitten book was out again… she knew the cute blond girl with a sunny smile to match her hair.  She must still b trying to convince her mother to let her have a cat.  She softly whispered to the book “you keep on trying little one… she’ll give in soon.”  She seemed to know everyone in the city though she didn’t know their names.  Rarely were there new books left out and if so they always seemed to be on the front table.  However, as she made her way to the back she noticed a very odd assortment of books laid out across a dark table.  It was an obscure table in the back non-fiction and reference section.  She almost never found books here.  Perhaps a map or two come summer time but during the winter no one would sit back here on this cold and ill lit corner of the library.  She approached normally to scoop up the books but she found herself still as she looked over them.  Out there on that table were half a dozen books that didn’t make much sense.  There was the King James Version of the Holy Bible; there was a book on landmines and bombs, and a bunch of medical journals.  She took a closer look at the medical journals.  They seemed primarily concerned with pregnancy.  A cold shiver shuddered her body as if a door had just been slammed.  She looked around in a frantic attempt to find the reader but she remembered that it was only she now and the janitor Bob.  She felt an urgent need to tell someone, but what could she say?  She’s just conjecturing now… but oh God… what if?    ******  It was late at night by the time the officers Lawrence and McKarney returned to headquarters to end their shift.  As they walked past some of the small window lined offices they noticed the same boy was sitting with one of the top detectives.  It was a bit of a shock.  The boy they had so closely examined earlier didn’t seem to be the criminal type.  John muttered something like running a ticket booth but both primarily thought he was a witness of some kind.  They had to know and so slinked to the captain’s office. “Sir, what’s the story with the kid over there in Carson’s office?” Officer Lawrence asked quietly.  Captain Bingham didn’t have time for their strange inquiry and answered them bluntly. “The kid’s a born-again and tried to blow up an abortion clinic downtown.” He said shortly in his heavy jersey accent.   Both cops were stunned.  Neither of them had expected it from such a simple looking rebel-without-a-cause.  They had seen dozens of them before.  This one stood out and now they know why.  Neither of them spoke as they went to prepare to go home. Before leaving Officer Lawrence saw that Detective Carson was alone and reading the notebook the kid had with him. “Do you mind, Jim?” he said reaching a hand out for the book.  Jim looked up at him quizzically and then back down to the page he was on. “You wouldn’t be the younger and optimistic looking cop, now would you?” he asked strangely.  Mike Lawrence didn’t understand at first but as soon as he started reading the book he had found that the young boy had definitely noticed his and his partner’s glances.  These two cops at the north corridor might be aware of my mission.  I wouldn’t know what to say to them if they caught me.  I’m just doing what I know is right in my heart.  I feel the young optimistic-looking one might sympathize with me, but I think scowling older one will be the first to walk over and investigate me.  Isn’t their motto ‘to protect and serve’?  What about protecting the freedom of every child brought into existence? Life and death is God’s alone and we should protect his right to have control over it.  We shouldn’t pretend we’re like God.  Maybe if they officers could just understand that they would help me do the right thing instead of sitting there and judging me.  Knowing what’s happening out there in the world… there is this great hollow of a feeling in me the longer I do nothing.  The hollow is greater than the entire grand central terminal.  I need to do what I feel is right and true.  Let God be the only one to judge me.  Mike looked in mourning as he shut his eyes from the writing and handed the old notebook back to Jim.  At first he mind was reeling with all those words.  How a boy could take something like this into his hands was unbelievable. “Hard to believe, huh?” he said to Mike trying ease whatever he’s feeling. “Yeah.” He was able to squeeze out from between his teeth. “It’s just one of those issues that get taken too far.  Frankly, I feel if you have a belief you shouldn’t force it on people.” He said matter-of-factly.  Mike thought about his words for a moment there, but the words of the boy were much more powerful.  He wasn’t a religious man but he knew his Scriptures.  The passion for right was almost admirable but the horrible feeling of wrongness was shuddering.  He thought about when he saw the boy and again he was so young.  Was there anyway he could have talked to him?  Was there anyway of reaching someone like that who thinks he is out there fighting a war to save everyone? “Mike,” Jims voice brought him out of his wonderings. “Yeah Jim?” Mike finally looked him in the eyes. “Go home.  You can’t think so deeply on these things.  You’ll wind up having a great hollow inside that you can’t fill.” He said.  With that Mike finally turned and left the office convinced to let the whole matter go.  Detective Carson was right, the kid was wrong.  The end.              ",2003-12-30

12032350,Female,27,Manufacturing,"        Hello turtle lovers. I took Buddy to the vet to get a check up and to make sure that I was taking good care of him. It was an all around wonderful experience. Jeff really is the Dog Whisperer. There was this terrified pit bull who kept trying it's hardest to crawl underneath Jeff's legs. He had this face on like 'please help me'. It was so cute. So back to Mr. Turtle... It's been confirmed! Mr. Turtle is a Mister. and oddly enough (much the the vet's excitement) he has a male symbol on his underside. We were so happy that he was healthy and happy that we went out and bought him a brand new home. A MUCH bigger aquarium and some new aquatic plants to nibble on. He LOVES it. I took pictures of him as well as all the snow that has been happening, but I have no way to upload them at this time. I can't wait to show you his underbelly (that sounds way more pervertish than I meant it to).    ",2003-02-20

Well do you remember&nbsp; how I was talking about this great/not so great job I have? Well I just found out this week that my days are numbered. I have about 3 weeks left before they kick me to the curb. The project is winding down and I knew this day was coming, but I&nbsp;was given&nbsp;the impression that it wouldn't&nbsp;be until the end of the year. So now I gotta start the whole job hunting thing again. My only ally, TH had to break the news to me on Monday. He really just told me as a heads up so I could start planning my next move. Thanks TH...at least someone&nbsp;around here shows me a little consideration. He also told me that he'd talk to the genius who suddenly decided to let me go and ask for&nbsp;more time.&nbsp;Overall I guess it's not so bad...I was ready for a change. Like I said before it is about time for me to really do something. I just don't know what made them realize all of a sudden that I'm not doing anything and my position really is pointless. Why did it take a year for you to realize that? It was good while it lasted.     &nbsp;   In other news, I began my guitar lessons. My friend KH and I go every Tuesday evening and take lessons. Our teacher, CC is really cool. He has been playing for 15 years and is trying to tailor the lessons to our musical tastes. We can bring in songs that we want to learn and he'll build around that. We have only had 2 lessons, but I am really enjoying it. The hardest part so far is coordinating the fingering, but I'm slowly getting it. On my own I've tried my hand at learning a few Tweet songs. I never realized how simplistic her guitar playing is until I pretty much figured out 3 songs in one evening (and remember ---I suck!). I really hope I continue to do well so that I can use the guitar while writing songs, but my fingers hurt!     &nbsp;   My brother will be in town this weekend for his 10 year high school reunion.&nbsp;Have we&nbsp;really been out of H.S. that long?! I'm getting old. I will get to spend some good quality time with my 2 year old niece while my brother and&nbsp;sister (in law)&nbsp;are at the reunion. That should be an adventure. I bought a pool and we'll just wing it from there.     &nbsp;    &nbsp;            ",2004-07-30

I guess keeping it on the front porch is not the best storage idea.  Oh well.  There's got to be some sort of life metaphor in BBQ, but I don't know what it is.  Normally, I don't like to toot my own horn, but I am a damn fine griller.  I get a lot of practice, since we don't have AC (just room units in the bedroom/computer room).

12032359,Female,27,Construction,"             Okay, this whole running/walking idea is working better than I thought. Today, I tried running 200 counts, walking 30 and repeating. I ended up running 700 counts and walking 120, and covered about 1.5 miles, which is three times as far as I can run if I just start and go until I have to stop. :) My next goal is to be able to make two loops around the park (2.6 miles) at the 200/30 ratio. Once I can do that, I'll probably switch to 300/30 and keep adjusting until I can run the whole thing. My goal right now is to be able to run 4 miles without walking by Trixie Camp. With roughly six weeks to go, I figure I'm in good shape.  Eating's still kind of up and down, mostly because I'm trying to use up odds and ends of food so I don't have to move it. But I'm being good about avoiding the snack machine at work and trying to keep things balanced.  Oh, and the paper's sponsoring a co-ed softball team this summer for the county league, and I signed up for that. Games start July 8, and I volunteered to be catcher. I did the same thing three summers ago and my legs got a great workout, since I basically spent 30 to 45 minutes a night doing deep knee bends once a week. :) This league plays two games a week, which will be good. No clue what it will do to my running, though. We shall see...         ",2004-06-08

I am Thomas Richbornage 35 the son of Late Sir Brian Richborna renowned Agriculturist, a Major Farm Land Owner and A Family Man In Zimbabwe, who will like to ask you for your assistance since the President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe has orderd that all White Land Owners should Leave the Country for them. The Black citizens accompanied with Military official came to raid most of us White Land owners But Lucky for My Family and I we were out to a safe place. So  those iniquitous beings laidtheir evil hands on our Workers and Destroyed properties. This  political issue suprising between White Farm Land Owners and The Government of Zimbabwe is making room for this so called envious bloodsucking people to take full advantage of the Situtation at Hand to cause a trouble and to terrorise most White Families Like  my Family and I, for all my growth and achievement we worked in Zimbabwe as gone down the drain My Family and I are willing to move to atemporary resident in Ghana and scared not to go back to Zimbabwe, I got your contact from the internet and the help of God, and have the impression that you will be capable of handling and helping us with your position.  My request is just your help, In helping me out of this situtation and to help me handle my money, which I wish to transfer to your country, All I want is for you to open an account for me in your name over there. All documents backing this money is with me, And allarrangement for the transfer will be in a hitch free process, Why I need this help is because the government are seizing all my Hard earned money in which we have worked for over the years because I will not want my family suffer for what they are not aware.  Kindly see this as a help and if you do help me, whichafter you send me an invitation to your country for My Family and I If you willing to help then i will give you 15 percent of the total money which is 35. Million Dollars which I have made over the years in Zimbabwe and is lodged in a reliable finance house. The foolproof arranegement of moving the funds to you in your country is to ship the boxes containing the cash to you through a reliable diplomatic courier company. You canfind thier modality below:  The cash $35 Million USD is in 2 boxes, the boxes will be shipped to yourbase and delivered to your doorstep through diplomatic courier service (DCS) of the External Affairs Ministry. I hope you know that Diplomatic luggage's cannot be check at any port of entry all over the world. Although diplomatic courier service is exclusively created for diplomats but I have a contact at the DCS office that will ensure that the box is shipped along with other diplomatic luggage's to you in your country. The contents of the box will be declared and Insured as classified documents and insurance bond instead of cash. This is a very serious arrangement that i have really thought about it before contacting you so do not panic because we know what to do to get a successfull result.  After receiving the box, you can then put the money in the bank for the proposed investment or keep it in a safe deposit box till I'm able to join you. DCS system of moving big volume of cash is safe and tested. In the light of this DCS modality, your thoughts, opinion and responseare welcome.  I want you to note that I will remove $60,000 USD out of the box and this will take care of the shipment expenses and other miscellenous arrangement.

12032371,Male,25,Maritime,"   8.15 A.M Tuesday Morning....  Waiting for the morning rush hour train as usual.  Almost couldn't get my butt off the bed just now.   Monday Blues had taken a huge toll on me, I almost couldn't survive the onerous boredom and tediousness of work yesterday.     Well, no choice gotta make a living and people are leaching off me as always.     Sigh!   Standing by the platform, I suddenly had a flash of inspiration again.  Instead of standing around in the train and getting shoved around, I should make space for my self to be comfortable.  Yes, my own space!  Of course, I have already thought of the very wonderful  Personal Space Maker , so what I thought of was not a new invention but something that is much more feasible.  Yes folks, a foldable chair. Not the big ones but a mini one that looks like one of those movie directors use.  Heh heh!   Of course, it is not wise to put the chair anywhere on the train, especially in the middle. Those punks will just rush in and topple me over.   Bad Idea, the middle.  So, before the train arrives, I will just shove my way to the front of the crowd who would already be standing inside the yellow box.  You know, I could have sworn the box meant for something for these guys? Like you are supposed to stand behind the yellow lines?   Well, nobody seems to care about that, what more me, the eternal law abiding fool? I've had enough!  I figure that I will probably get a lot of irritated stares by doing that but no one will actually dare voice it out.  Hey, they let the guy in Bishan walk around the station aimlessly, sit on the edge of the platform and then junped into the path of the oncoming MRT.   No one bothered to even report the matter to the station's staff before all that even if they could tell he was a suicide case.  So, in typical Singaporean fashion, we will do what we always do when faced with an out of ordinary situation - use Eye Power.  That's an army term for just staring and not lifting a finger to help when needed or asked to.  Anyway, back to my ingenious plan... The best spot will be at the doors opposite of the the front doors. There, you can get to lean your back against the plastic panel by the side.   It's a good spot also because everyone else will be squeezing to the middle of the train. Can't imagine why when the back is relatively empty before we reach Jurong East Interchange.  Well, everyone's stupidity is my gain. Suckers.  I will probably attract a lot of attention but that's not neccessarily a bad thing.  My fellow commuters may think  that I a looney and keep their distance, thus according me with more space than I would need.  AH AH AH - I am starting to think I am a genius and the rest morons.  AHHHH! I can just imagine the comfort now.  No more getting shoved around, getting told off for trying to protect my hard-earned personal space and getting POKED in the most uncomfortable places by thoughtless and insensitive commuters.

12032372,Male,15,Maritime,"       It's another lovely day in the neighborhood with the 9/11 Commision and Investigative Panel, where dumb struck congressmen restate the obvious and make it look like new news!  Shall we take today's headline of the  Chicago Tribune :    Panel: No Iraq link to 9/11    DUH! How fucking stupid are these people!  How long have we already know this?!  MONTHS! YEARS! GOD DAMN DECADES!  Why does the American public need a 1.5' Headline to Realize that There was no connection between Iraq and 9/11!  I WANT TO SHIT MY PANTS!  I would like to take a moment now to predict the future.  What is going to happen in Iraq?  Hmm, that's a damn good question.  Let's take ANOTHER look at one of today's Headlines from the one and only  Chicago Tribune :    Sadr tells militia to stand down, says he will form political party    Just fucking GREAT!  The last thing that Iraq fucking needs is a god damn cleric pissing off the U.S. forces while also undermining their efforts by actually gaining popular support for a religious dictatorship! DO YOU SEE THE CONNECTION?!...  'Hello, this is Hitler speaking.  This is who?  Moqtada al who?  S�derr?  What did you call me?!  Are you a Jew?  Oh, you hate Jews?  How lovely!  You seek to reclaim the land the Jews have stolen from your people?  What a coincidence, I happen to want the exact same thing!  What's this, organized violence and holy war?  Oh this is turning me on, don't stop!  DON'T STOP!  What?!  The west is evil?  I smell an alliance... what did you say your name was?  Could you spell that out please?  Ok, hold on, lemme get a pen here... ok go.  M-O-Q-T-A-D-A  A-L  S-A-D-R... I'll try to remember that.  Oo, what's this?  Your a naughty boy?  Oh my, now this is getting somewhere...'  Yes Ladies and Gentlemen, boys and girls: Sadr is just like fucking Hitler!  Except the Jews already have a national state, control the region and have key alliances with the U.S., the other thing Sadr hates (that being western unethical values).  WHAT SHALL WE DO!  I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.  I'm gonna go to Max B.'s house and pickup the stuff I left at his house from the weekend of the Art Fair.  And then I'm goin' to bed.

John Kerry has picked John Edwards as his running mate, and already Fox News has people commenting on their possible homosexual relationship.  I have final realized how destructive politics are in this country.  Politics make this country weak by dividing us, and that is why this nation is suffering.  Countries can achieve great things when united, or fuck up really bad when not.  Rush Limbaugh makes me sick.  So does the flu.  Once upon a time, there was a little duck.  One day, this duck went to see his uncle.  When he saw his uncle outside his house fishing, the duck quacked, 'Uncle!'  The little duck's uncle looked up and saw his nephew, and greeted him with open wings.  Then a hunter shot the uncle.  And so the little duck ran back to his home and called the FBI.  Soon a crime seen was setup where the shooting had occured.  Apparently this was not the first shooting, and the FBI was already hot on the tail of the renegade hunter.  And so the FBI asked Congress to pass a bill that would require all citizens to have an I.D. card, that they must carry with them at all times.  This way, the FBI could track down the hunter easier.  Soon the FBI needed mroe help, and called the CIA.  They put a spending bill through Congress as part of the Department of Defenses 'Black Budget' that would allow them to tap and record all phone, mail, and electronic forms of communication without authorization.  Soon the FBI caught the hunter, and publicised the story widely, to gain public support for the agency.  However, even though renegade hunters were not at large and crime rates were down to an all time low, the FBI and CIA asked Congress to repass the old bills.  Congress did as they were told, fearing that questioning the bill would cause them to loose public support in the next election.  And so the little duck grew old, and soon he became an uncle as well.  But he was run over by a semi on I-94, and was squashed like a peanut-butter and jelly sandwich in a second graders lunch.

12032381,Male,23,Tourism,"             This years race started at the hotel. Just under 130 folks met up on Saturday morning .... the usual mix of beardies, racing snakes, tubbies with some wimen thrown in to dilute the ugly. The first road section was mad - more like a 10k road race than anything. Clever German thought ..... 'dinnae get caught up in the event, plenty time for the fast stuff'. What I failed to take into account was how hard it would be to pass anyone in the forest section. Once on the open hill, it was easier to make up ground but the effort required was sore. Over the first steep ascent (they put us on a more direct line to the left of the tourist path) and the field was really spread out along the plateau section. Again, they put us on a more direct line towards the summit ridge. I was just starting up that last climb when the lead runner came past at a tremendous pace !    Reached the cairn at 1hr 2mins. Was trying to get there under the hour but just couldn't get the time back after the forest. The descent started well with hopes of under the 30mins. The summit ridge and first descent were fantastic fun. However by the time the plateau was under the heels, the legs were screaming ! Bad enough the quads being sore the day after ..... but during ???? At the end of the plateau, it was fast becoming as funny as the long score with cramp. The section towards the forest was torture ... not only the feeling in the legs and being unsure of the footing but also watching the sub-90mins target fade. By the time I was back in the forest it was more about keeping running than getting a time. Nearly spewed heading back along the road to finish in 1:37:45  The upside as I walked back to the car was seeing Lynne, she smiled said 'well done' and handed me a whisky ! I spent the next 20 mins lying on a rock eating a snickers bar with ma whisky - intermittently dipping the feet in the loch. Other folks were having wee cool down runs and eating fruit. Lynne commented 'is that not what you should be doin ?'  Next year target - Sub 90 mins !  Cheers The German            ",2004-05-12

12032383,Female,23,Tourism,"                 oh man, where do i start with friday.  well, i'll start at the beginning.  circa 8:15am i called nia and left her a mind blowing rendition of happy birthday on her voicemail.    fast forward to 7:00pm and i'm running out the door in a race to get down to commerce and back to lorenzo's by 7:30.  i picked up joseph at wawa and we patiently waited outside lorenzos for sarah and big den.  and when i say patiently, i mean i was tweeking his nipples because i was so hungry.  so the devries finally arrive and we eat and head back to big den's so we can drop all the cars off and so joseph can change his 'outfit.'   the drive down was....well death defying to say the least.  sarah was tailing the car in front of us so close it actually felt like we were in his backseat.  dennis offered to tap him on the shoulder and ask him to speed up.  we also listened to some...well interesting music.  it was especially tear jerking when sarah, dennis, and joseph all started singing, 'all by myself,' in unison.  tears of joy? no.  more like, ohhh my goooood make it stoooppppppppp.    so we get to mcfaddens and it's pouring of course.  and the guy at the front door decided to flex some bouncer muscle and ask me for back up ID, but whatever.  so we get inside and beth and dave arrive shortly after, and then marissa and mike aka warnock aka kegCHUUUGGGGA.  at this point i was itching for a shot but joseph refused to buy me one, and marissa was like nia will be MAAAAAAD, so i waited.  and then....DING DING DING there's the birthday girl!!!  looking hizzot as hell.  FINALLY I CAN HAVE A SHOT.  it was soco and lime for everyone!!!  sarah shoved poor nia out of the way and made her way straight for mike's crotch.  you think i jest, but i don't.  then again, i grabbed his butt as soon as he walked in, so i'm sure he was expecting it.  soon, marissa heads downstairs to go to the bathroom and secretly smoke a cigarette i'm sure when i realize, kegchugga is singing along to every song that comes on inside the bar, especially beastie boys.  when he screams shrilly as the bar is dead silent, i resolve to pretend that i don't know him for the rest of the night.  rest of the night?? no more like rest of the century!!!    so the rest of mike/nia's friends get there and the night is progressing smoothly.  but where is kegchugga everyone is asking???  hrmm, it's a mystery.  ::keep in mind this man is missing, because it's a key to the later plot::  by this point i've broken the seal and am peeing every 15-20 minutes.  so i head downstairs to the potty where sarah shows me that if you sit on the bench at the right angle, you can see into the guy's bathroom and watch everyone pee at the urinal!!  so everyone else heads downstairs into the blue room.  it's alot better down there, better music, and hey, there's kegchugga in the middle of a dancing circle thing WITH A GIRL!!!  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!??!?!  i could literally see the shit hit the fan and it was not pretty.  so we all stood there, staring at him, and joseph was like man i'm dumb, but that guy is a MORON.  now how do you come to a bar with a girl, who you're sharing a hotel room with for the night, and dance with OTHER GIRLS!??!?!  i'm still boggled by this.    at this point i'm a shot, three raspberry vodka and sprites, and about 3 beers in.  things are starting to get good!!  joseph proudly humps a wall which leads me to rapid fire evacuation of the premises.  corrie, terrie, and couple other girls have arrived and you know what that means....MORE SHOTS!!!  hehe, two more shots later i'm like so what i'm druuuuuuuuunk.  well not really, but kinda, though i wouldn't admit it.  the birthday girl aka nia's shirt has slowly unraveled.  and don't think she was happy about it.  oh yes, we'll be taking that shit back!!!   back to the warnock situation, marissa is now ticked off, and he comes over to talk to her.  things seemed to have gone alright, marissa is smiling and warnock is getting her a beer, only to immediately return to DANCING WITH GIRLS!!!  i would have chopped his balls off at this point, but marissa remained calm cool and collected....for like 5 more minutes.  needless to say they made an early exit.  hey, it's last call and the lights have come on.  we wanna go to pat's for cheesesteaks.  upstairs, i try and convey this message to nia, but she just stares at me blankly.  so i tell mike that's where we're headed and wish him luck with his drunk ass girlfriend.  me joseph sarah dennis beth and dave all cram into ferdie and head to south street in search of a good cheesesteak and then drop beth and dave off and head home.  me and joseph spend 1/3 of the ride home making out before i pass out and wake up in north brunswick.  hehe, it was a very good night and a special mention has to go to the text msg i receieved from nia at 2:05am which stated, 'Im waqded.'   Yes folks, translated loosely it says, I'm wasted.  As long as Nia had fun, the night was a success.    hehe, that is all.  i've drained myself of all my creativity and writing capabilities.  i will now recover with a nap.             ",2004-04-25
12032384,Male,25,Tourism,"        Losing my wheels = losing my mind    So, I no longer have the use of my Subaru. I am pretty down about this. It all is due to the fact that Geico, the car insurance provider that I acquired whilst in New Hampshire, does not cover Canada - something to do with fault vs no-fault insurance.  'That's fine' I said to myself and promptly I began to look for another provider . . . . . and then I realised that to get insurance here in Canada I need to legally import the car here to Canada, a prospect that will probably end up costing me in the low thousands of dollars. I can't afford that. So, my car languishes in the driveway, undriveable and lonely. It also somehow managed to acquire a flat tire a few days ago. Blah. So, I am calling the New Hampshire dealership to find out if they'll buy it back, or if it would make more economic sense to just import it and sell it here. In the meantime however this means that I no longer have the freedom that I once did.   I could go anywhere at any time, bound only by the limitations of a 9-5 job. Just hop in the 'Ru and I could go where I please, accompanied by a large selection of cds and a 6 disc changer to bring the sound to me.   Now, I have to share a car with my dad. Not just any car either but a 12 year old Honda that is nearing it's final days. A car that my parents don't trust to go anywhere outside the city.  This bums me out.  ----------------------------------------------   Toronto: The Pathetic Poser City   or, Why I Am Proudly Uncool   So, I was talking to my new Australian friend Evan last weekend and we made plans to get a few people together and go out to a Drum and Bass night so that we could find some good music to dance to.  To DANCE to.  So, Evan, Brent, Jess and I went out to the Gypsy Co-op on Queen St. West for some Drum and Bass dancing. The music itself was pretty cool.   The people there thought they were.  I haven't seen this many people with arms folded staring at one another since a middle school dance. The only thing that prevented me from believing that I hadn't been magically whisked back to the hallowed gym at Islington Junior Middle School was the fact that the guys and girls weren't standing on opposite sides, staring each other down. The four of us decided to get a dance floor going and hopefully everyone else will start. I must point out that at this time it was around midnight, and there should have been a dance floor started by at least 10 o'clock, but then again I am uncool in this city of attitude, so what do I know. Anyway, the four of us are dancing, the rest of the crowd is standing and staring, the d.j. is spinning some pretty cool music and there's this one weird white guy with a microphone turned down really low and is doing what I can only surmise is some kind of Sean-Paul-faux-reggae-shoutouts/what-the-hell-are-you-doing-you-dumb-putz-shut-up-and-dance. You really had to see it, it was hilarious. The bottom line of this rant story is that only about 10 percent of those in the room were dancing, which seemed silly to me because it was too loud in the bar to carry on any kind of sustained conversation, so the only alternative to dancing was to stand there and pose. Way to go everyone.   So, I need to find another place where there is good music to dance to and people will dance to it.  It's a big city    blargh  ajc         ",2004-05-31

12032388,Male,23,Tourism,"       Well, this is supposed to be a diary so I'll talk like it is.  Life, eh?  Life at the moment consists of the following: cooking, cleaning, eating, sleeping (although not very much), training and worrying. There may also be the the odd spell of drinking and some kissing involved.  It's the training that's worrying me. I always used to just 'go out on my bike'. Now I 'train'. I don't consciously push myself harder when I ride/run/paddle, but I notice myself sometimes attacking that hill just a bit harder, sprinting faster for that ball, etc etc ad nauseaum..  Why? I have no personal motivation, however, I do have a big fear of letting the team down. Always have. that's why I pushed myself at rugby, at kayak polo, and why I love adventure racing: I get to do all the sports I love for recreation, and I get to push myself for other people's sakes.  Heb Challenge is going to be the longest race, both in duration and distance, that I have competed in. I'll be biking, running and kayaking. Running is the weakest of my disciplines, so I'm training a bit harder for that. However, I'm also putting in some hard bike loops every week - not having a car forces me to train. I like this.  We also have the Pen-y-Ghent race coming up - 5 mile fell race, so we'll see exactly what stage of training I'm up to before the Heb.  The kayaking worries me a bit. I'm fine in a kayak, but I'm used to whitewater, not big expanses of open sea. You can avoid rocks, you can't avoid waves...  Anyway. That's all forn the philosophy of the over-tired.

I was rather on the verge of getting over someone and yes, and you were my diversion. a pleasant one indeed. i hope i did entertain you just the same. really! I was supposed to feel jittery the day you dropped by my office but no... it was like seeing someone i already knew well. I promise to try to see one of your games on tv next time. haha! so... yoga soon? harhar!! hey! was with charry last friday. we really should all gather for coffee or something... in the meantime, hoooy! be good. haha.  KIM - someone finally has the same food preference! ITALIAN! hmm.hmm.hmm. AMOROMA. over prosciutto ham pizza and pasta alfredo, kim and i managed to hit it off, effortlessly. Overwhelming as your friendster invite was, it was nothing compared to the mixed emotions that crawled through my spine (yes, my emotions are part of my 'neurotic' nervous system now!) when you picked me up from rcbc that day. My boss was actually frantic that you were picking me up with your eye-candy GOLD Expedition. She said she wouldnt know where to get ransom if i get kidnapped. A small boy with a BIG toy. (i'd say man, but it doesnt rhyme!) I wonder if you've migrated back to hong kong. I do appreciate you texting me once in a while... at 1am, 2am and sometimes 3am... hahaha. How's business goin kim? I have high regards for your accomplishments... hey! dont underestimate this dude.. franchise of jollibee, greenwich, grocery shops... should i go on and on? the fact that you had to work as 'crew' was humbling on your part and remarkable to my eyes (and everyone else who knows that story im sure!) MY favorite memory of you? HAH! easy. when you asked me... 'BABY ka pa ba?' suave kim... suave....and 'cute' i must say. keep in touch kim. I would like to have you around.  MARCO - YOU were the nicest....and yes, youngest! (24!) the idea that you were into YFC (Youth for Christ) won you a date. hands down. Oh, seeing that OLD and AGED text message of yours saying that you hope to see a movie with me did some greasing as well. I miss YFC too. I actually can't think of a specific reason, well aside from age, why i can't bring myself to responding to your text msgs in as sweet a manner as you use yourself. Hmmm... there is something getting in the way. I'm not sure. That phonecall before you got out of my car was weird. Yeah, gave me cold chills actually. 'Kinda speculated it was a girlfriend (ex or otherwise). My thoughts? eeeghad... i hope i didnt just go out with someone 'attached.' I wouldn't want to violate my own dating rules. that's a no-no. NO-brainer to be precise. I was kind of worried though how you would be going home. It may sound selfish yes but... in this dating process that's taking eternity for me, i am hopeful that i find my-man-to-be, neither someone i'd be taking a caregiver's course nor be up against a pedophile case for.  Oh!...and someone with an ex-gf tailing is definitely not in my list of pleasantries. (believe me, my list is short!) i wont forget, as i said...you were really, really, ooober nice!  MYKEL - thank you for the enriching asian experience. As i told you before you make up for almost ALL asian identities, having been born in taiwan, raised in malaysia and singapore, and based here in manila. ooops! did i miss a detail? Among all my dates, i would say you were the most profound. The conversations were loved for the mere fact that they can be as intellectual as they can get. I never had a substantial amount of reverence for Buddhism and those other religions until you spoke about them with so much passion. Hey! have you been to davao or boracay again lately? if i get crazy enough to do something spur-of-the-moment and hmm... a lil expensive than usual, i might take you up on that boracay offer.... with the other B's... hahaha. You've met them right? I'll see you when your resto opens okay? Or even before that... must recharge my rusty good ol' brain.   DON - You were actually my first brave attempt to go out with someone OLDER... (hey! i didnt say old!) half-BRITISH, half-FILIPINO. Made me imagine you coming down from a good-looking, well 'breed,' for lack of a better term. LIBIS. SAN FRANCISCO COFFEE. 7pm. You said you have work at 8pm. That at least gives me an hour to endure whatever was about to transpire. For some weird reason, friends were texting me to call them in case i find myself in ANY trouble. KEY's in. ignition starts. I was actually looking out for more space to maneouver my way out of the space where i parked til my focus was disrupted by a text message. It read... 'WANNA GO TO SOMEWHERE PRIVATE LATER?' I was holding my breath while adrenalin rushed up to my brain, almost out through the car roof. Instead of killing you (thank GOD you weren't anywhere near), i killed the engine. oHAHAHAHAo! Now i can laugh about it. We did go to somewhere private. HIS house. My house. SEPARATELY. I thought he needed as much privacy as he can get anyway. In fairness, dude apologized for being 'offensive.' Hmmmm... smell my feet you BRIT. ;)    MR. ENGINEER - Okay, so i decided to go out with someone older again. No foreign blood this time. You have proven to be the MOST gentleman and couth among all my dates. I mean what is it about older men anyway? well a lot. Professional, sensible and daym! They just know how to take care of their dates. HANDS DOWN. Hey! you even inspired me to write a separate entry for the experience. I hope God makes more of your kind... seriously!  GERMAN - no he isnt of any german origin. It's just the first word that comes to mind when i remember this dude since well, associations! There goes my next leap to going out with someone younger. 2 years aint that too big a deal anyway!? I was only apprehensive about the fact that it had to be another set-up. I mean what are the chances that this date spoils my momentum again? Hmmm... HIGH. Fortunately for me, you didnt give me any reason to regret it. It was apparent that despite the age difference, you were able to level with me. Your principles, those definitely got you the title, 'interesting.'   more soon...          ",2004-06-15

12032392,Female,23,Environment,"                 It's fun to mess with people in my field sometimes when they find out I'm not only a Christian but a Republican to boot.  It's often confusing even for me, though.  Take  urlLink this story , for instance.  As a republican, I'm totally all about what Bush is doing.  Give power to the states! Kudos for giving important decision-making powers to the people!  The federal government has its sticky little fingers in enough pots.  Not to mention the fact that land managers and biologists out there THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA to sell off some timber that has been fire-free for way too long and could result in another crazy, destructive, out-of-control wildlfire like we've been seeing over the past few years.  News flash, folks: wildfires are NATURAL.  They're supposed to happen even so often to keep brush down and native habitat, well, habitable and not charred beyond help when a fire does break out.  I know some people (not just wack tree-hugging ecoterrorists who have no understanding about the biology behind land management) have a very hands-off opinion about how we should approach our natural resources and forests.  Ok, I can see your point.  Let nature do its thing and run its course.  That's very idealist and great and all, but humans have messed with nature's systems enough that just letting things run their course would probably be more detrimental than trying to help by active management.  We messed it up by supressing wildfire and preventing forests from naturally purging themselves by desperately trying to protect them from being logged completely.  And this is where I'm a bit conflicted.  If we didn't let the federal government pass roadless area laws and stop those greedy bloodthirsty loggers from taking every last stick and turning it into a matchbox condo, forests as our founding fathers knew them would disappear.  And don't gimme any of that crap about there being so much forest that we don't even know what to do with it and how much uninhabited land there is out there.  Most uninhabited land is the most 'useless': deserts, barren mountain-tops, swamps and marshes (that get drained and filled anyway).  The land that is most crucial for many endangered flora and fauna (that's plants and animals for you city folk) is always the land that humans take first too.  Lewis and Clark thought development would never reach the west, and look at us now.    So what to do?  Let individual states decide how to manage their forests which would likely result in far more logging to boost suffering economies, or allow the federal government to decide what's protected and what's not, even in our own backyards?  Do we trust the average joe-citizen to make responsible decisions and not cut down all the wood to make a buck now that will be spent to buy a new car or flat-screen tv to replace the new ones he bought a year ago?  If YOU had 5,000 acres of prime timber and wetland to do with as you pleased would you harvest it and fill it for housing developments so you could get that new siding your wife has been nagging you about and paying off the 5 credit cards you maxed out? Or it is just possible that you would preserve it for its intrinsic value?  Can society as a whole be trusted to make environmentally-conscious decisions to use what we have wisely, leaving some for our great-great-great-great grandchildren?  Or shall we simply give up and say ' Not if hell froze over!  Let our government take over and make all our decisons for us!  Let's give them control over our how we spend our money, raise our children, where we live, how long we live, and what to do with our land!  Screw capitalism in any form because I can't be trusted to help my fellow man and do right by the earth.  I'm too selfish and if you give me any control I'll take everything for myself. I DESERVE a new car every year, steak every night for dinner, a new wardrobe every season, so you'd better stop me.'   Back to work.  Enjoy the heat if you're in WI today.               ",2004-07-11

I am in the process of quitting my job, which I will not go into more than to say I am grateful.  I'm currently enrolled at the  urlLink UC Davis Graduate School of Management  for the fall quarter of this year, which I am a little worried about.  I still need to find somewhere to live and figure out how I'm going to survive biz school.  The blog title, by the way has nothing to do with this.  I'm planning to travel a little with my girlfriend this summer, and thats about it.    At the moment, I'm 24. I live in San Francisco.  I like to fish, ski, bike, and spend time outdoors.  I live in an apartment with five people including my girlfriend.  I'm white, I went to Middlebury College in Vermont.  I grew up in San Francisco.  I work for a non profit environmental organization.  I drive an Infiniti G20.  I have a little sister who is a student at UVM.  My desk is a mess.  My life seems to be on track.      ",2004-06-22
12032396,Female,27,Environment,"              We've got this gift of love, but love is like a precious plant. You can't just accept it and leave it in the cupboard or just think it's going to get on by itself. You've got to keep watering it. You've got to really look after it and nurture it. ~John Lennon   It's not so easy anymore - we're not in school, we've got careers, bills to pay, other friends to see, family to be with, boyfriends and numerous other responsibilities.   We recognize that we've changed, but are we readily adapting, supporting and remaining true to each other as friends? Do we really even know what's going on in each other's lives?  These are questions I hope to get answered when I go away with my friends in a few weeks. We all need a vacation, and though it's been rough trying to arrange our schedules and deciding on a place to go, we've finally settled on something that works for all of us. At the very least, we'll all be together!  For this trip, I hope that we'll all be able speak frankly to each other about what's going on in our lives, good or bad. These are my closest friends, but sometimes I feel like I don't know them very well anymore, and that they don't really know me.   Of course, we're all guilty of neglecting each other, but if I can count on one thing, I can count on my friends always being there for me if I need them, even if we're not in constant communication with each other. Even so, I miss my friends, and it's frustrating when you've got great people around you that you can't see more of. This trip will give me an opportunity to reconnect, look after and nurture the friendships that are so important to me.           ",2004-03-17

12032399,Female,16,Environment,"           camping was wonderful, from what i remember. saturday elise and i cooked vegan stew. everyone huddled around the fire playing an intense game of 'i never' and getting wasted on cheap boxed franzia and boone's. we took it down to the waterside for 'spin the bottle.' sarah, mo, mike, brian, and i headed over to the adjacent campsite at 2:00 in the morning to party with iowan boys, and while waiting for sarah to finish making out with one of them (kyle?) in the backseat of his lesabre, i had stoned political debate until 5:00. the next morning i woke at 9:00, drove around with kyle on country backroads and through the various north 1st streets of small towns passing a one-hitter back and forth.  copasetic.  last night was not so pleasant. i stopped by broadway to fill my empty stomach with black coffee and catch up with some friends, wandered around westport for a while (grateful to be back in the city), headed over to passages. who should be there than ava martin, dressed in her usual black boots, army jacket, plugs--the epitome of a heartless dyke. as usual she had 10 different phone numbers scribbled on her forearm, half of them made up for the image.   she drags me off on a walk to the church parking lot, procedes to tell me all the details of her latest fuck buddy, and then says  ' kate, let's fuck. ' ' excuse me? ' ' let's fuck. right here. why not? '  bends over and starts to kiss me as if i'm going to lay myself out on the pavement at her feet. i run back in and we start to argue about jasmine, ava of course tossing around her usual slew of lies and claims  ' i'll bet you $100 i can get into her pants by the end of next month. '  how absolutely despicable can you be? i ended up in the shotgun of molly's car, listening to 'gravel' and crying at my own naivety. i give her chance after chance to prove me right, that deep down there is genuine love and goodness inside of her, and every time she lets me down. i can't help trusting in people. i can't help my optimism, and it plagues me sometimes . . . i need to get away from her. she's self-destructive and she's a threat to every relationship i value. i hadn't been angry for years, but last night i felt like slamming my fist through the apartment wall.  i can't let it happen again. i don't know why i keep giving her second chances.  peace           ",2004-06-18
